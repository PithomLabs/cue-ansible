    - Tested against the following platforms and images
      - N9k 7.0(3)I4(6), 7.0(3)I5(3), 7.0(3)I6(1), 7.0(3)I7(1), 7.0(3)F2(2), 7.0(3)F3(2)

    - This module requires both the ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT and
      ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT timers to be set to 600 seconds or higher.
      The module will exit if the timers are not set properly.
    - When using connection local, ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT and
      ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT can only be set using ENV variables or
      the ansible.cfg file.
    - Do not include full file paths, just the name of the file(s) stored on
      the top level flash directory.
    - This module attempts to install the software immediately,
      which may trigger a reboot.
    - In check mode, the module will indicate if an upgrade is needed and
      whether or not the upgrade is disruptive or non-disruptive(ISSU).

            - Selecting 'required' or 'yes' means that upgrades will only
              proceed if the switch is capable of ISSU.
            - Selecting 'desired' means that upgrades will use ISSU if possible
              but will fall back to disruptive upgrade if needed.
            - Selecting 'no' means do not use ISSU. Forced disruptive.
        choices: ['required','desired', 'yes', 'no']
        default: 'no'
