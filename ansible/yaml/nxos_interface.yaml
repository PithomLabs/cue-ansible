notes:
  - Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
  - This module is also used to create logical interfaces such as
    svis and loopbacks.
  - Be cautious of platform specific idiosyncrasies. For example,
    when you default a loopback interface, the admin state toggles
    on certain versions of NX-OS.
  - The M(nxos_overlay_global) C(anycast_gateway_mac) attribute must be
    set before setting the C(fabric_forwarding_anycast_gateway) property.
