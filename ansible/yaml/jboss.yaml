notes:
  - The JBoss standalone deployment-scanner has to be enabled in standalone.xml
  - The module can wait until I(deployment) file is deployed/undeployed by deployment-scanner.
    Duration of waiting time depends on scan-interval parameter from standalone.xml.
  - Ensure no identically named application is deployed through the JBoss CLI
