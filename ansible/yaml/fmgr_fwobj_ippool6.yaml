      - EXPERTS ONLY! KNOWLEDGE OF FMGR JSON API IS REQUIRED!
      - List of multiple child objects to be added. Expects a list of dictionaries.
      - Dictionaries must use FortiManager API parameters, not the ansible ones listed below.
      - If submitted, all other prefixed sub-parameters ARE IGNORED.
      - This object is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with its options.
      - We expect that you know what you are doing with these list parameters, and are leveraging the JSON API Guide.
