  filters:
    description:
      - An alternative to using vpn_connection_id. If multiple matches are found, vpn_connection_id is required.
        If one of the following suboptions is a list of items to filter by, only one item needs to match to find the VPN
        that correlates. e.g. if the filter 'cidr' is ['194.168.2.0/24', '192.168.2.0/24'] and the VPN route only has the
        destination cidr block of '192.168.2.0/24' it will be found with this filter (assuming there are not multiple
        VPNs that are matched). Another example, if the filter 'vpn' is equal to ['vpn-ccf7e7ad', 'vpn-cb0ae2a2'] and one
        of of the VPNs has the state deleted (exists but is unmodifiable) and the other exists and is not deleted,
        it will be found via this filter. See examples.
