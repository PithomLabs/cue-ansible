module: win_inet_proxy
version_added: '2.8'
short_description: Manages proxy settings for WinINet and Internet Explorer
description:
- Used to set or remove proxy settings for Windows INet which includes Internet
  Explorer.
- WinINet is a framework used by interactive applications to submit web
  requests through.
- The proxy settings can also be used by other applications like Firefox,
  Chrome, and others but there is no definitive list.
options:
  auto_detect:
    description:
    - Whether to configure WinINet to automatically detect proxy settings
      through Web Proxy Auto-Detection C(WPAD).
    - This corresponds to the checkbox I(Automatically detect settings) in the
      connection settings window.
    default: yes
    type: bool
  auto_config_url:
    description:
    - The URL of a proxy configuration script.
    - Proxy configuration scripts are typically JavaScript files with the
      C(.pac) extension that implement the C(FindProxyForURL(url, host)
      function.
    - Omit, set to null or an empty string to remove the auto config URL.
    - This corresponds to the checkbox I(Use automatic configuration script) in
      the connection settings window.
    type: str
  bypass:
    description:
    - A list of hosts that will bypass the set proxy when being accessed.
    - Use C(<local>) to match hostnames that are not fully qualified domain
      names. This is useful when needing to connect to intranet sites using
      just the hostname. If defined, this should be the last entry in the
      bypass list.
    - Use C(<-loopback>) to stop automatically bypassing the proxy when
      connecting through any loopback address like C(127.0.0.1), C(localhost),
      or the local hostname.
    - Omit, set to null or an empty string/list to remove the bypass list.
    - If this is set then I(proxy) must also be set.
    type: list
  connection:
    description:
    - The name of the IE connection to set the proxy settings for.
    - These are the connections under the I(Dial-up and Virtual Private Network)
      header in the IE settings.
    - When omitted, the default LAN connection is used.
    type: str
  proxy:
    description:
    - A string or dict that specifies the proxy to be set.
    - If setting a string, should be in the form C(hostname), C(hostname:port),
      or C(protocol=hostname:port).
    - If the port is undefined, the default port for the protocol in use is
      used.
    - If setting a dict, the keys should be the protocol and the values should
      be the hostname and/or port for that protocol.
    - Valid protocols are C(http), C(https), C(ftp), and C(socks).
    - Omit, set to null or an empty string to remove the proxy settings.
notes:
- This is not the same as the proxy settings set in WinHTTP through the
  C(netsh) command. Use the M(win_http_proxy) module to manage that instead.
- These settings are by default set per user and not system wide. A registry
  property must be set independently from this module if you wish to apply the
  proxy for all users. See examples for more detail.
- If per user proxy settings are desired, use I(become) to become any local
  user on the host. No password is needed to be set for this to work.
- If the proxy requires authentication, set the credentials using the
  M(win_credential) module. This requires I(become) to be used so the
  credential store can be accessed.
