    description:

    type: str
  network:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the trap network. This option is not supported in
        versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0. If used on versions < 12.1.0, it will simply
        be ignored.
      - The value C(default) was removed in BIG-IP version 13.1.0. Specifying this
        value when configuring a BIG-IP will cause the module to stop and report
        an error. The usual remedy is to choose one of the other options, such as
        C(management).
    type: str
    choices:
      - other
      - management
      - default

    version_added: 2.5
notes:
  - This module only supports version v1 and v2c of SNMP.
  - The C(network) option is not supported on versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0 because
    the platform did not support that option until 12.1.0. If used on versions
    < 12.1.0, it will simply be ignored.
