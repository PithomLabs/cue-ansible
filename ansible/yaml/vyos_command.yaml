module: vyos_command
version_added: "2.2"
author: "Nathaniel Case (@Qalthos)"
short_description: Run one or more commands on VyOS devices
description:
  - The command module allows running one or more commands on remote
    devices running VyOS.  This module can also be introspected
    to validate key parameters before returning successfully.  If the
    conditional statements are not met in the wait period, the task
    fails.
  - Certain C(show) commands in VyOS produce many lines of output and
    use a custom pager that can cause this module to hang.  If the
    value of the environment variable C(ANSIBLE_VYOS_TERMINAL_LENGTH)
    is not set, the default number of 10000 is used.

  commands:
    description:
      - The ordered set of commands to execute on the remote device
        running VyOS.  The output from the command execution is
        returned to the playbook.  If the I(wait_for) argument is
        provided, the module is not returned until the condition is
        satisfied or the number of retries has been exceeded.
    required: true
  wait_for:
    description:
      - Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command
        and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause
        the task to wait for a particular conditional to be true
        before moving forward.  If the conditional is not true
        by the configured I(retries), the task fails. See examples.
    aliases: ['waitfor']
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
        I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy. Valid
        values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value is set to C(all)
        then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
        satisfied.
    default: all
    choices: ['any', 'all']
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the I(wait_for)
        conditionals.
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between I(retries)
        of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    default: 1

notes:
  - Tested against VyOS 1.1.8 (helium).
  - Running C(show system boot-messages all) will cause the module to hang since
    VyOS is using a custom pager setting to display the output of that command.
  - If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible
    to pass a dict containing I(command), I(answer) and I(prompt). See examples.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli). See L(the VyOS OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_vyos.html).
