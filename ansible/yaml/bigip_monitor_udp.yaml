options:
  name:
    description:
      - Monitor name.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the C(udp)
        parent on the C(Common) partition.

    type: str
    version_added: 2.7
  send:
    description:
      - The send string for the monitor call. When creating a new monitor, if
        this value is not provided, the default C(default send string) will be used.
    type: str
  receive:
    description:
      - The receive string for the monitor call.
    type: str
  receive_disable:
    description:
      - This setting works like C(receive), except that the system marks the node
        or pool member disabled when its response matches the C(receive_disable)
        string but not C(receive). To use this setting, you must specify both
        C(receive_disable) and C(receive).
    type: str
  ip:
    description:
      - IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'.
    type: str
  port:
    description:
      - Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535
        must be specified.
    type: str
  interval:
    description:
      - The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this
        template will run. If this parameter is not provided when creating
        a new monitor, then the default value will be 5. This value B(must)
        be less than the C(timeout) value.
    type: int
  timeout:
    description:
      - The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to
        the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time
        period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within
        the set time period, it is considered down. You can change this
        number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the
        interval number of seconds plus 1 second. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 16.
    type: int
  time_until_up:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful
        response before a node will be marked up. A value of 0 will cause a
        node to be marked up immediately after a valid response is received
        from the node. If this parameter is not provided when creating
        a new monitor, then the default value will be 0.
    type: int
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
