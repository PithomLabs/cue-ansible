author: "Peter Sprygada (@privateip)"
short_description: Configure Infoblox NIOS host records
description:
  - Adds and/or removes instances of host record objects from
    Infoblox NIOS servers.  This module manages NIOS C(record:host) objects
    using the Infoblox WAPI interface over REST.
  - Updates instances of host record object from Infoblox NIOS servers.
requirements:
  - infoblox-client

  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the fully qualified hostname to add or remove from
        the system. User can also update the hostname as it is possible
        to pass a dict containing I(new_name), I(old_name). See examples.

      - Sets the DNS view to associate this host record with.  The DNS
        view must already be configured on the system

      ipv4addr:
        description:
          - Configures the IPv4 address for the host record. Users can dynamically
            allocate ipv4 address to host record by passing dictionary containing,
            I(nios_next_ip) and I(CIDR network range). If user wants to add or
            remove the ipv4 address from existing record, I(add/remove)
            params need to be used. See examples

      configure_for_dhcp:
        description:

        description:
          - If user wants to add the ipv4 address to an existing host record.
            Note that with I(add) user will have to keep the I(state) as I(present),
            as new IP address is allocated to existing host record. See examples.

          - If user wants to remove the ipv4 address from an existing host record.
            Note that with I(remove) user will have to change the I(state) to I(absent),
            as IP address is de-allocated from an existing host record. See examples.

    description:
      - Configures an optional list of additional aliases to add to the host

  state:
    description:
      - Configures the intended state of the instance of the object on
        the NIOS server.  When this value is set to C(present), the object
