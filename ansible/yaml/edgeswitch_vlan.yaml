short_description: Manage VLANs on Ubiquiti Edgeswitch network devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of VLANs
    on Ubiquiti Edgeswitch network devices.
notes:
  - Tested against edgeswitch 1.7.4
  - This module use native Ubiquiti vlan syntax and does not support switchport compatibility syntax.
    For clarity, it is strongly advised to not use both syntaxes on the same interface.
  - Edgeswitch does not support deleting or changing name of VLAN 1
  - As auto_tag, auto_untag and auto_exclude are a kind of default setting for all interfaces, they are mutually exclusive

options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the VLAN.
  vlan_id:
    description:
      - ID of the VLAN. Range 1-4093.
  tagged_interfaces:
    description:
      - List of interfaces that should accept and transmit tagged frames for the VLAN.
        Accept range of interfaces.
  untagged_interfaces:
    description:
      - List of interfaces that should accept untagged frames and transmit them tagged for the VLAN.
        Accept range of interfaces.
  excluded_interfaces:
    description:
      - List of interfaces that should be excluded of the VLAN.
        Accept range of interfaces.
  auto_tag:
    description:
      - Each of the switch interfaces will be set to accept and transmit
        untagged frames for I(vlan_id) unless defined in I(*_interfaces).
        This is a default setting for all switch interfaces.
    type: bool
  auto_untag:
    description:
      - Each of the switch interfaces will be set to accept untagged frames and
        transmit them tagged for I(vlan_id) unless defined in I(*_interfaces).
        This is a default setting for all switch interfaces.
    type: bool
  auto_exclude:
    description:
      - Each of the switch interfaces will be excluded from I(vlan_id)
        unless defined in I(*_interfaces).
        This is a default setting for all switch interfaces.
    type: bool
  aggregate:
    description: List of VLANs definitions.
  purge:
    description:
      - Purge VLANs not defined in the I(aggregate) parameter.
    default: no
