module: ec2_customer_gateway
short_description: Manage an AWS customer gateway
description:
    - Manage an AWS customer gateway.
version_added: "2.2"
author: Michael Baydoun (@MichaelBaydoun)
requirements: [ botocore, boto3 ]
notes:
    - You cannot create more than one customer gateway with the same IP address. If you run an identical request more than one time, the
      first request creates the customer gateway, and subsequent requests return information about the existing customer gateway. The subsequent
      requests do not create new customer gateway resources.
    - Return values contain customer_gateway and customer_gateways keys which are identical dicts. You should use
      customer_gateway. See U(https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/issues/2773) for details.
