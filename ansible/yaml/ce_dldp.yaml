notes:
    - The relevant configurations will be deleted if DLDP is disabled using enable=disable.
    - When using auth_mode=none, it will restore the default DLDP authentication mode. By default,
      DLDP packets are not authenticated.
    - By default, the working mode of DLDP is enhance, so you are advised to use work_mode=enhance to restore default
      DLDP working mode.
    - The default interval for sending Advertisement packets is 5 seconds, so you are advised to use time_interval=5 to
      restore default DLDP interval.
    - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
    - Recommended connection is C(netconf).
    - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
