module: bigip_device_auth
short_description: Manage system authentication on a BIG-IP
description:
  - Manage the system authentication configuration. This module can assist in configuring
    a number of different system authentication types. Note that this module can not be used
    to configure APM authentication types.
version_added: 2.7
options:
  type:
    description:
      - The authentication type to manage with this module.
      - Take special note that the parameters supported by this module will vary depending
        on the C(type) that you are configuring.
      - This module only supports a subset, at this time, of the total available auth types.
    type: str
    choices:
      - tacacs
      - local
  servers:
    description:
      - Specifies a list of the IPv4 addresses for servers using the Terminal
        Access Controller Access System (TACACS)+ protocol with which the system
        communicates to obtain authorization data.
      - For each address, an alternate TCP port number may be optionally specified
        by specifying the C(port) key.
      - If no port number is specified, the default port C(49163) is used.
      - This parameter is supported by the C(tacacs) type.
    type: raw
    suboptions:
      address:
        description:
          - The IP address of the server.
          - This field is required, unless you are specifying a simple list of servers.
            In that case, the simple list can specify server IPs. See examples for
            more clarification.
      port:
        description:
          - The port of the server.
        default: 49163
  secret:
    description:
      - Secret key used to encrypt and decrypt packets sent or received from the
        server.
      - B(Do not) use the pound/hash sign in the secret for TACACS+ servers.
      - When configuring TACACS+ auth for the first time, this value is required.
    type: str
  service_name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the service that the user is requesting to be
        authorized to use.
      - Identifying what the user is asking to be authorized for, enables the
        TACACS+ server to behave differently for different types of authorization
        requests.
      - When configuring this form of system authentication, this setting is required.
      - Note that the majority of TACACS+ implementations are of service type C(ppp),
        so try that first.
    type: str
    choices:
      - slip
      - ppp
      - arap
      - shell
      - tty-daemon
      - connection
      - system
      - firewall
  protocol_name:
    description:
      - Specifies the protocol associated with the value specified in C(service_name),
        which is a subset of the associated service being used for client authorization
        or system accounting.
      - Note that the majority of TACACS+ implementations are of protocol type C(ip),
        so try that first.
    type: str
    choices:
      - lcp
      - ip
      - ipx
      - atalk
      - vines
      - lat
      - xremote
      - tn3270
      - telnet
      - rlogin
      - pad
      - vpdn
      - ftp
      - http
      - deccp
      - osicp
      - unknown
  authentication:
    description:
      - Specifies the process the system employs when sending authentication requests.
      - When C(use-first-server), specifies that the system sends authentication
        attempts to only the first server in the list.
      - When C(use-all-servers), specifies that the system sends an authentication
        request to each server until authentication succeeds, or until the system has
        sent a request to all servers in the list.
      - This parameter is supported by the C(tacacs) type.
    type: str
    choices:
      - use-first-server
      - use-all-servers
  use_for_auth:
    description:
      - Specifies whether or not this auth source is put in use on the system.
    type: bool
  state:
    description:
      - The state of the authentication configuration on the system.
      - When C(present), guarantees that the system is configured for the specified C(type).
      - When C(absent), sets the system auth source back to C(local).
    type: str
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
    default: present
  update_secret:
    description:
      - C(always) will allow to update secrets if the user chooses to do so.
      - C(on_create) will only set the secret when a C(use_auth_source) is C(yes)
        and TACACS+ is not currently the auth source.
    type: str
    choices:
      - always
      - on_create
    default: always
