short_description: netconf device configuration
description:
    - Netconf is a network management protocol developed and standardized by
      the IETF. It is documented in RFC 6241.
    - This module allows the user to send a configuration XML file to a netconf
      device, and detects if there was a configuration change.
extends_documentation_fragment:
    - netconf
    - network_agnostic
options:
  content:
    description:
     - The configuration data as defined by the device's data models, the value can be either in
       xml string format or text format. The format of the configuration should be supported by remote
       Netconf server
    aliases: ['xml']
  target:
    description:
      Name of the configuration datastore to be edited.
      - auto, uses candidate and fallback to running
      - candidate, edit <candidate/> datastore and then commit
      - running, edit <running/> datastore directly
    default: auto
    version_added: "2.4"
    aliases: ['datastore']
  source_datastore:
    description:
    - Name of the configuration datastore to use as the source to copy the configuration
      to the datastore mentioned by C(target) option. The values can be either I(running), I(candidate),
      I(startup) or a remote URL
    version_added: "2.7"
    aliases: ['source']
  format:
    description:
    - The format of the configuration provided as value of C(content). Accepted values are I(xml) and I(text) and
      the given configuration format should be supported by remote Netconf server.
    default: xml
    choices: ['xml', 'text']
    version_added: "2.7"
  lock:
    description:
      - Instructs the module to explicitly lock the datastore specified as C(target). By setting the option
        value I(always) is will explicitly lock the datastore mentioned in C(target) option. It the value
        is I(never) it will not lock the C(target) datastore. The value I(if-supported) lock the C(target)
        datastore only if it is supported by the remote Netconf server.
    default: always
    choices: ['never', 'always', 'if-supported']
    version_added: "2.7"
  default_operation:
    description:
    - The default operation for <edit-config> rpc, valid values are I(merge), I(replace) and I(none).
      If the default value is merge, the configuration data in the C(content) option is merged at the
      corresponding level in the C(target) datastore. If the value is replace the data in the C(content)
      option completely replaces the configuration in the C(target) datastore. If the value is none the C(target)
      datastore is unaffected by the configuration in the config option, unless and until the incoming configuration
      data uses the C(operation) operation to request a different operation.
    choices: ['merge', 'replace', 'none']
    version_added: "2.7"
  confirm:
    description:
    - This argument will configure a timeout value for the commit to be confirmed before it is automatically
      rolled back. If the C(confirm_commit) argument is set to False, this argument is silently ignored. If the
      value of this argument is set to 0, the commit is confirmed immediately. The remote host MUST
      support :candidate and :confirmed-commit capability for this option to .
    default: 0
    version_added: "2.7"
  confirm_commit:
    description:
    - This argument will execute commit operation on remote device. It can be used to confirm a previous commit.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    version_added: "2.7"
  error_option:
    description:
    - This option controls the netconf server action after an error occurs while editing the configuration.
    - If I(error_option=stop-on-error), abort the config edit on first error.
    - If I(error_option=continue-on-error), continue to process configuration data on error.
      The error is recorded and negative response is generated if any errors occur.
    - If I(error_option=rollback-on-error), rollback to the original configuration if
      any error occurs.
      This requires the remote Netconf server to support the I(error_option=rollback-on-error) capability.
    default: stop-on-error
    choices: ['stop-on-error', 'continue-on-error', 'rollback-on-error']
    version_added: "2.7"
  save:
    description:
      - The C(save) argument instructs the module to save the configuration in C(target) datastore to the
        startup-config if changed and if :startup capability is supported by Netconf server.
    default: false
    version_added: "2.4"
    type: bool
  backup:
    description:
      - This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of
        the current C(running-config) from the remote device before any
        changes are made. If the C(backup_options) value is not given,
        the backup file is written to the C(backup) folder in the playbook
        root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an
        ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    version_added: "2.7"
  delete:
    description:
      - It instructs the module to delete the configuration from value mentioned in C(target) datastore.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    version_added: "2.7"
  commit:
    description:
      - This boolean flag controls if the configuration changes should be committed or not after editing the
        candidate datastore. This option is supported only if remote Netconf server supports :candidate
        capability. If the value is set to I(False) commit won't be issued after edit-config operation
        and user needs to handle commit or discard-changes explicitly.
    type: bool
    default: True
    version_added: "2.7"
  validate:
    description:
      - This boolean flag if set validates the content of datastore given in C(target) option.
        For this option to work remote Netconf server should support :validate capability.
    type: bool
    default: False
    version_added: "2.7"
  src:
    description:
    - Specifies the source path to the xml file that contains the configuration or configuration template
      to load. The path to the source file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or
      a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with I(xml).
    version_added: "2.4"
  backup_options:
    description:
      - This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path.
        The value of this option is read only when C(backup) is set to I(yes), if C(backup) is set
        to I(no) this option will be silently ignored.
    suboptions:
      filename:
        description:
          - The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename
            is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
            in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
      dir_path:
        description:
          - This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup
            configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be first
            created and the filename is either the value of C(filename) or default filename
            as described in C(filename) options description. If the path value is not given
            in that case a I(backup) directory will be created in the current working directory
            and backup configuration will be copied in C(filename) within I(backup) directory.
        type: path
    type: dict
    version_added: "2.8"
  get_filter:
    description:
      - This argument specifies the XML string which acts as a filter to restrict the portions of
        the data retrieved from the remote device when comparing the before and after state of the
        device following calls to edit_config. When not specified, the entire configuration or
        state data is returned for comparison depending on the value of C(source) option. The C(get_filter)
        value can be either XML string or XPath, if the filter is in XPath format the NETCONF server
        running on remote host should support xpath capability else it will result in an error.
    version_added: "2.10"
requirements:
  - "ncclient"
notes:
  - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on
    the remote device being managed.
  - This module supports devices with and without the candidate and
    confirmed-commit capabilities. It will always use the safer feature.
  - This module supports the use of connection=netconf
