short_description: Manages SNMP users for monitoring.

    - Manages SNMP user configuration.

notes:
    - Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
    - Authentication parameters not idempotent.
options:
    user:
        description:
            - Name of the user.
        required: true
    group:
        description:
            - Group to which the user will belong to.
              If state = present, and the user is existing,
              the group is added to the user. If the user
              is not existing, user entry is created with this
              group argument.
              If state = absent, only the group is removed from the
              user entry. However, to maintain backward compatibility,
              if the existing user belongs to only one group, and if
              group argument is same as the existing user's group,
              then the user entry also is deleted.
    authentication:
        description:
            - Authentication parameters for the user.
        choices: ['md5', 'sha']
    pwd:
        description:
            - Authentication password when using md5 or sha.
              This is not idempotent
    privacy:
        description:
            - Privacy password for the user.
              This is not idempotent
    encrypt:
        description:
            - Enables AES-128 bit encryption when using privacy password.
        type: bool
    state:
        description:
            - Manage the state of the resource.
        default: present
        choices: ['present','absent']
