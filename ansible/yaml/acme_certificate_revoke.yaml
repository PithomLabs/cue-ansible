version_added: "2.7"
short_description: Revoke certificates with the ACME protocol
description:
   - "Allows to revoke certificates issued by a CA supporting the
      L(ACME protocol,https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555),
      such as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/)."
notes:
   - "Exactly one of C(account_key_src), C(account_key_content),
      C(private_key_src) or C(private_key_content) must be specified."
   - "Trying to revoke an already revoked certificate
      should result in an unchanged status, even if the revocation reason
      was different than the one specified here. Also, depending on the
      server, it can happen that some other error is returned if the
      certificate has already been revoked."
