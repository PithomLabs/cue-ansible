    availability_zone:
        description:
            - Specifies the AZ where you want to create the disk.
        type: str
        required: true
    name:
        description:
            - Specifies the disk name. The value can contain a maximum of 255
              bytes.
        type: str
        required: true
    volume_type:
        description:
            - Specifies the disk type. Currently, the value can be SSD, SAS, or
              SATA.
            - SSD specifies the ultra-high I/O disk type.
            - SAS specifies the high I/O disk type.
            - SATA specifies the common I/O disk type.
            - If the specified disk type is not available in the AZ, the
              disk will fail to create. If the EVS disk is created from a
              snapshot, the volume_type field must be the same as that of the
              snapshot's source disk.
        type: str
        required: true
    backup_id:
        description:
            - Specifies the ID of the backup that can be used to create a disk.
              This parameter is mandatory when you use a backup to create the
              disk.
        type: str
        required: false
    description:
        description:
            - Specifies the disk description. The value can contain a maximum
              of 255 bytes.
        type: str
        required: false
    enable_full_clone:
        description:
            - If the disk is created from a snapshot and linked cloning needs
              to be used, set this parameter to True.
        type: bool
        required: false
    enable_scsi:
        description:
            - If this parameter is set to True, the disk device type will be
              SCSI, which allows ECS OSs to directly access underlying storage
              media. SCSI reservation command is supported. If this parameter
              is set to False, the disk device type will be VBD, which supports
              only simple SCSI read/write commands.
            - If parameter enable_share is set to True and this parameter
              is not specified, shared SCSI disks are created. SCSI EVS disks
              cannot be created from backups, which means that this parameter
              cannot be True if backup_id has been specified.
        type: bool
        required: false
    enable_share:
        description:
            - Specifies whether the disk is shareable. The default value is
              False.
        type: bool
        required: false
    encryption_id:
        description:
            - Specifies the encryption ID. The length of it fixes at 36 bytes.
        type: str
        required: false
    enterprise_project_id:
        description:
            - Specifies the enterprise project ID. This ID is associated with
              the disk during the disk creation. If it is not specified, the
              disk is bound to the default enterprise project.
        type: str
        required: false
    image_id:
        description:
            - Specifies the image ID. If this parameter is specified, the disk
              is created from an image. BMS system disks cannot be
              created from BMS images.
        type: str
        required: false
    size:
        description:
            - Specifies the disk size, in GB. Its values are as follows, System
              disk 1 GB to 1024 GB, Data disk 10 GB to 32768 GB. This
              parameter is mandatory when you create an empty disk or use an
              image or a snapshot to create a disk. If you use an image or a
              snapshot to create a disk, the disk size must be greater than or
              equal to the image or snapshot size. This parameter is optional
              when you use a backup to create a disk. If this parameter is not
              specified, the disk size is equal to the backup size.
        type: int
        required: false
    snapshot_id:
        description:
            - Specifies the snapshot ID. If this parameter is specified, the
              disk is created from a snapshot.
        type: str
        required: false
