notes:
  - Two environment variables can be used, DO_API_KEY and DO_API_TOKEN. They both refer to the v2 token.
  - As of Ansible 1.9.5 and 2.0, Version 2 of the DigitalOcean API is used, this removes C(client_id) and C(api_key) options in favor of C(api_token).
  - If you are running Ansible 1.9.4 or earlier you might not be able to use the included version of this module as the API version used has been retired.
    Upgrade Ansible or, if unable to, try downloading the latest version of this module from github and putting it into a 'library' directory.
requirements:
  - "python >= 2.6"
  - dopy
