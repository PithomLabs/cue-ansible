short_description: Manage the VRF definitions on Juniper JUNOS devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of VRF definitions on
    Juniper JUNOS devices.  It allows playbooks to manage individual or
    the entire VRF collection.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the VRF definition to be managed on the remote IOS
        device.  The VRF definition name is an ASCII string name used
        to uniquely identify the VRF.  This argument is mutually exclusive
        with the C(aggregate) argument
  description:
    description:
      - Provides a short description of the VRF definition in the
        current active configuration.  The VRF definition value accepts
        alphanumeric characters used to provide additional information
        about the VRF.
  rd:
    description:
      - The router-distinguisher value uniquely identifies the VRF to
        routing processes on the remote IOS system.  The RD value takes
        the form of C(A:B) where C(A) and C(B) are both numeric values.
  interfaces:
    description:
      - Identifies the set of interfaces that
        should be configured in the VRF. Interfaces must be routed
        interfaces in order to be placed into a VRF.
  target:
    description:
      - It configures VRF target community configuration. The target value takes
        the form of C(target:A:B) where C(A) and C(B) are both numeric values.
  table_label:
    description:
      - Causes JUNOS to allocate a VPN label per VRF rather than per VPN FEC.
        This allows for forwarding of traffic to directly connected subnets, COS
        Egress filtering etc.
    type: bool
  aggregate:
    description:
      - The set of VRF definition objects to be configured on the remote
        JUNOS device.  Ths list entries can either be the VRF name or a hash
        of VRF definitions and attributes.  This argument is mutually
        exclusive with the C(name) argument.
  state:
    description:
      - Configures the state of the VRF definition
        as it relates to the device operational configuration.  When set
        to I(present), the VRF should be configured in the device active
        configuration and when set to I(absent) the VRF should not be
        in the device active configuration
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
  active:
    description:
      - Specifies whether or not the configuration is active or deactivated
    default: True
    type: bool
requirements:
  - ncclient (>=v0.5.2)
notes:
  - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on
    the remote device being managed.
  - Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
  - Recommended connection is C(netconf). See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
  - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
