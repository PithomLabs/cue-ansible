module: panos_query_rules
short_description: PANOS module that allows search for security rules in PANW NGFW devices.
description: >
    - Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed. The
    policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches the
    traffic is applied, the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.
