short_description: Add or remove an apt key
description:
    - Add or remove an I(apt) key, optionally downloading it.
notes:
    - Doesn't download the key unless it really needs it.
    - As a sanity check, downloaded key id must match the one specified.
    - "Use full fingerprint (40 characters) key ids to avoid key collisions.
      To generate a full-fingerprint imported key: C(apt-key adv --list-public-keys --with-fingerprint --with-colons)."
    - If you specify both the key id and the URL with C(state=present), the task can verify or add the key as needed.
    - Adding a new key requires an apt cache update (e.g. using the apt module's update_cache option)
requirements:
    - gpg
options:
    id:
        description:
            - The identifier of the key.
            - Including this allows check mode to correctly report the changed state.
            - If specifying a subkey's id be aware that apt-key does not understand how to remove keys via a subkey id.  Specify the primary key's id instead.
            - This parameter is required when C(state) is set to C(absent).
