notes:
  - The DNS Made Easy service requires that machines interacting with the API have the proper time and timezone set. Be sure you are within a few
    seconds of actual time by using NTP.
  - This module returns record(s) and monitor(s) in the "result" element when 'state' is set to 'present'.
    These values can be be registered and used in your playbooks.
  - Only A records can have a monitor or failover.
  - To add failover, the 'failover', 'autoFailover', 'port', 'protocol', 'ip1', and 'ip2' options are required.
  - To add monitor, the 'monitor', 'port', 'protocol', 'maxEmails', 'systemDescription', and 'ip1' options are required.
  - The monitor and the failover will share 'port', 'protocol', and 'ip1' options.
