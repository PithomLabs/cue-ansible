description:
    - Enable, disable, drain and set weights for HAProxy backend servers using socket commands.
notes:
    - Enable, disable and drain commands are restricted and can only be issued on
      sockets configured for level 'admin'. For example, you can add the line
      'stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock level admin' to the general section of
      haproxy.cfg. See U(http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/configuration.txt).
    - Depends on netcat (nc) being available; you need to install the appropriate
      package for your operating system before this module can be used.
options:
  backend:
    description:
      - Name of the HAProxy backend pool.
      - If this parameter is unset, it will be auto-detected.
    type: str
  drain:
    description:
      - Wait until the server has no active connections or until the timeout
        determined by wait_interval and wait_retries is reached.
      - Continue only after the status changes to 'MAINT'.
      - This overrides the shutdown_sessions option.
    type: bool
    version_added: "2.4"
  host:
    description:
      - Name of the backend host to change.
    type: str
    required: true
  shutdown_sessions:
    description:
      - When disabling a server, immediately terminate all the sessions attached
        to the specified server.
      - This can be used to terminate long-running sessions after a server is put
        into maintenance mode. Overridden by the drain option.

  socket:
    description:
      - Path to the HAProxy socket file.

      - Note that C(drain) state was added in version 2.4.
      - It is supported only by HAProxy version 1.5 or later,
      - When used on versions < 1.5, it will be ignored.

  wait:
    description:
      - Wait until the server reports a status of 'UP' when C(state=enabled),
        status of 'MAINT' when C(state=disabled) or status of 'DRAIN' when C(state=drain)
    type: bool
    default: no

  wait_interval:
    description:
      - Number of seconds to wait between retries.

    type: int
    default: 25
    version_added: "2.0"
  weight:
    description:
      - The value passed in argument.
      - If the value ends with the `%` sign, then the new weight will be
        relative to the initially configured weight.
      - Relative weights are only permitted between 0 and 100% and absolute
        weights are permitted between 0 and 256.
