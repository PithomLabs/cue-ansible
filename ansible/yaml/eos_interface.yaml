short_description: Manage Interface on Arista EOS network devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of Interfaces
    on Arista EOS network devices.
deprecated:
  removed_in: "2.13"
  alternative: eos_interfaces
  why: Updated modules released with more functionality
notes:
    - Tested against EOS 4.15
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the Interface to be configured on remote device. The name of interface
        should be in expanded format and not abbreviated.
    type: str
    required: true
  description:
    description:
      - Description of Interface upto 240 characters.
    type: str
  enabled:
    description:
      - Interface link status. If the value is I(True) the interface state will be
        enabled, else if value is I(False) interface will be in disable (shutdown) state.
    default: True
    type: bool
  speed:
    description:
      - This option configures autoneg and speed/duplex/flowcontrol for the interface
        given in C(name) option.
    type: str
  mtu:
    description:
      - Set maximum transmission unit size in bytes of transmit packet for the interface given
        in C(name) option.
    type: str
  tx_rate:
    description:
      - Transmit rate in bits per second (bps) for the interface given in C(name) option.
      - This is state check parameter only.
      - Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
    type: str
  rx_rate:
    description:
      - Receiver rate in bits per second (bps) for the interface given in C(name) option.
      - This is state check parameter only.
      - Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
    type: str
  neighbors:
    description:
      - Check the operational state of given interface C(name) for LLDP neighbor.
      - The following suboptions are available.
    type: list
    suboptions:
        host:
          description:
            - "LLDP neighbor host for given interface C(name)."
        port:
          description:
            - "LLDP neighbor port to which given interface C(name) is connected."
  aggregate:
    description:
      - List of Interfaces definitions. Each of the entry in aggregate list should
        define name of interface C(name) and other options as required.
    type: list
  delay:
    description:
      - Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote
        device. This wait is applicable for operational state argument which are
        I(state) with values C(up)/C(down), I(tx_rate) and I(rx_rate).
    default: 10
    type: int
  state:
    description:
      - State of the Interface configuration, C(up) means present and
        operationally up and C(down) means present and operationally C(down)
    default: present
    type: str
    choices: ['present', 'absent', 'up', 'down']
