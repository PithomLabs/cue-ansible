module: ldap_passwd
short_description: Set passwords in LDAP.
description:
  - Set a password for an LDAP entry.  This module only asserts that
    a given password is valid for a given entry.  To assert the
    existence of an entry, see M(ldap_entry).
notes:
  - The default authentication settings will attempt to use a SASL EXTERNAL
    bind over a UNIX domain socket. This works well with the default Ubuntu
    install for example, which includes a cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth ACL
    rule allowing root to modify the server configuration. If you need to use
    a simple bind to access your server, pass the credentials in I(bind_dn)
    and I(bind_pw).
