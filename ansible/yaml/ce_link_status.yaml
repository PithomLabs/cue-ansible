notes:
    - Current physical state shows an interface's physical status.
    - Current link state shows an interface's link layer protocol status.
    - Current IPv4 state shows an interface's IPv4 protocol status.
    - Current IPv6 state shows an interface's  IPv6 protocol status.
    - Inbound octets(bytes) shows the number of bytes that an interface received.
    - Inbound unicast(pkts) shows the number of unicast packets that an interface received.
    - Inbound multicast(pkts) shows the number of multicast packets that an interface received.
    - Inbound broadcast(pkts) shows  the number of broadcast packets that an interface received.
    - Inbound error(pkts) shows the number of error packets that an interface received.
    - Inbound drop(pkts) shows the total number of packets that were sent to the interface but dropped by an interface.
    - Inbound rate(byte/sec) shows the rate at which an interface receives bytes within an interval.
    - Inbound rate(pkts/sec) shows the rate at which an interface receives packets within an interval.
    - Outbound octets(bytes) shows the number of the bytes that an interface sent.
    - Outbound unicast(pkts) shows  the number of unicast packets that an interface sent.
    - Outbound multicast(pkts) shows the number of multicast packets that an interface sent.
    - Outbound broadcast(pkts) shows the number of broadcast packets that an interface sent.
    - Outbound error(pkts) shows the total number of packets that an interface sent but dropped by the remote interface.
    - Outbound drop(pkts) shows the number of dropped packets that an interface sent.
    - Outbound rate(byte/sec) shows the rate at which an interface sends bytes within an interval.
    - Outbound rate(pkts/sec) shows the rate at which an interface sends packets within an interval.
    - Speed shows the rate for an Ethernet interface.
    - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
    - Recommended connection is C(netconf).
    - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.

        description:
            - For the interface parameter, you can enter C(all) to display information about all interfaces,
              an interface type such as C(40GE) to display information about interfaces of the specified type,
              or full name of an interface such as C(40GE1/0/22) or C(vlanif10)
              to display information about the specific interface.
        required: true
