        description:
        - Type of Method used to configure the interface.
        - method depends on other settings such as the use of a static IP address, which will change the method to static.
        - loopback - Used to define the IPv4 loopback interface.
        - manual - Used to define interfaces for which no configuration is done by default.
        - dhcp - May be used to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
        - static - Used to define Ethernet interfaces with statically allocated IPv4 addresses.
