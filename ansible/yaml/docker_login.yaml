module: docker_login
short_description: Log into a Docker registry.
version_added: "2.0"
description:
    - Provides functionality similar to the "docker login" command.
    - Authenticate with a docker registry and add the credentials to your local Docker config file respectively the
      credentials store associated to the registry. Adding the credentials to the config files resp. the credential
      store allows future connections to the registry using tools such as Ansible's Docker modules, the Docker CLI
      and Docker SDK for Python without needing to provide credentials.
    - Running in check mode will perform the authentication without updating the config file.

    description:
      - This controls the current state of the user. C(present) will login in a user, C(absent) will log them out.
      - To logout you only need the registry server, which defaults to DockerHub.
      - Before 2.1 you could ONLY log in.
      - Docker does not support 'logout' with a custom config file.
