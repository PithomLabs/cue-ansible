short_description: Manage Linux capabilities
description:
    - This module manipulates files privileges using the Linux capabilities(7) system.
version_added: "1.6"
options:
    path:
        description:
            - Specifies the path to the file to be managed.
        type: str
        required: yes
        aliases: [ key ]
    capability:
        description:
            - Desired capability to set (with operator and flags, if state is C(present)) or remove (if state is C(absent))
        type: str
        required: yes
        aliases: [ cap ]
    state:
        description:
            - Whether the entry should be present or absent in the file's capabilities.
        type: str
        choices: [ absent, present ]
        default: present
notes:
    - The capabilities system will automatically transform operators and flags into the effective set,
      so for example, C(cap_foo=ep) will probably become C(cap_foo+ep).
    - This module does not attempt to determine the final operator and flags to compare,
      so you will want to ensure that your capabilities argument matches the final capabilities.
