short_description: Manage EC2 launch templates
description:
  - Create, modify, and delete EC2 Launch Templates, which can be used to
    create individual instances or with Autoscaling Groups.
  - The I(ec2_instance) and I(ec2_asg) modules can, instead of specifying all
    parameters on those tasks, be passed a Launch Template which contains
    settings like instance size, disk type, subnet, and more.

  block_device_mappings:
    description:
    - The block device mapping. Supplying both a snapshot ID and an encryption
      value as arguments for block-device mapping results in an error. This is
      because only blank volumes can be encrypted on start, and these are not
      created from a snapshot. If a snapshot is the basis for the volume, it
      contains data by definition and its encryption status cannot be changed
      using this action.

          store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The
          number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance
          type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

              performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume
              accumulates I/O credits for bursting. For more information about

              bursting, see Amazon EBS Volume Types in the Amazon Elastic
