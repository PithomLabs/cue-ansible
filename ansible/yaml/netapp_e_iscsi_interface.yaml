    controller:
        description:
            - The controller that owns the port you want to configure.
            - Controller names are presented alphabetically, with the first controller as A,
             the second as B, and so on.
            - Current hardware models have either 1 or 2 available controllers, but that is not a guaranteed hard
             limitation and could change in the future.
        required: yes
        choices:
            - A
            - B
    name:
        description:
            - The channel of the port to modify the configuration of.
            - The list of choices is not necessarily comprehensive. It depends on the number of ports
              that are available in the system.
            - The numerical value represents the number of the channel (typically from left to right on the HIC),
              beginning with a value of 1.
        required: yes
        aliases:
            - channel
    state:
        description:
            - When enabled, the provided configuration will be utilized.
            - When disabled, the IPv4 configuration will be cleared and IPv4 connectivity disabled.
        choices:
            - enabled
            - disabled
        default: enabled
    address:
        description:
            - The IPv4 address to assign to the interface.
            - Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
            - Mutually exclusive with I(config_method=dhcp)
    subnet_mask:
        description:
            - The subnet mask to utilize for the interface.
            - Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
            - Mutually exclusive with I(config_method=dhcp)
    gateway:
        description:
            - The IPv4 gateway address to utilize for the interface.
            - Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
            - Mutually exclusive with I(config_method=dhcp)
    config_method:
        description:
            - The configuration method type to use for this interface.
            - dhcp is mutually exclusive with I(address), I(subnet_mask), and I(gateway).
        choices:
            - dhcp
            - static
        default: dhcp
    mtu:
        description:
            - The maximum transmission units (MTU), in bytes.
            - This allows you to configure a larger value for the MTU, in order to enable jumbo frames
              (any value > 1500).
            - Generally, it is necessary to have your host, switches, and other components not only support jumbo
              frames, but also have it configured properly. Therefore, unless you know what you're doing, it's best to
              leave this at the default.
        default: 1500
        aliases:
            - max_frame_size
    log_path:
        description:
            - A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        required: no
notes:
    - Check mode is supported.
    - The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address
      via dhcp, etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
    - This module will not be useful/usable on an E-Series system without any iSCSI interfaces.
    - This module requires a Web Services API version of >= 1.3.
