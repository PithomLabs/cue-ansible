module: certificate_complete_chain
author: "Felix Fontein (@felixfontein)"
version_added: "2.7"
short_description: Complete certificate chain given a set of untrusted and root certificates
description:
    - "This module completes a given chain of certificates in PEM format by finding
       intermediate certificates from a given set of certificates, until it finds a root
       certificate in another given set of certificates."
    - "This can for example be used to find the root certificate for a certificate chain
       returned by M(acme_certificate)."
    - "Note that this module does I(not) check for validity of the chains. It only
       checks that issuer and subject match, and that the signature is correct. It
       ignores validity dates and key usage completely. If you need to verify that a
       generated chain is valid, please use C(openssl verify ...)."
