module: docker_config

short_description: Manage docker configs.

version_added: "2.8"

description:
     - Create and remove Docker configs in a Swarm environment. Similar to C(docker config create) and C(docker config rm).
     - Adds to the metadata of new configs 'ansible_key', an encrypted hash representation of the data, which is then used
       in future runs to test if a config has changed. If 'ansible_key' is not present, then a config will not be updated
       unless the I(force) option is set.
     - Updates to configs are performed by removing the config and creating it again.
options:
  data:
    description:
      - The value of the config. Required when state is C(present).
    type: str
  data_is_b64:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), the data is assumed to be Base64 encoded and will be
        decoded before being used.
      - To use binary I(data), it is better to keep it Base64 encoded and let it
        be decoded by this option.
    type: bool
    default: no
  labels:
    description:
      - "A map of key:value meta data, where both the I(key) and I(value) are expected to be a string."
      - If new meta data is provided, or existing meta data is modified, the config will be updated by removing it and creating it again.
    type: dict
  force:
    description:
      - Use with state C(present) to always remove and recreate an existing config.
      - If C(true), an existing config will be replaced, even if it has not been changed.
    type: bool
    default: no
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the config.
    type: str
    required: yes
  state:
    description:
      - Set to C(present), if the config should exist, and C(absent), if it should not.
    type: str
    default: present
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
