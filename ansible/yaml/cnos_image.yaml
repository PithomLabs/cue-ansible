short_description: Perform firmware upgrade/download from a remote server on
                   devices running Lenovo CNOS
description:
    - This module allows you to work with switch firmware images. It provides a
     way to download a firmware image to a network device from a remote server
     using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a directory
     from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is to provide
     the full file path of the image's location. Authentication details
     required by the remote server must be provided as well. By default, this
     method makes the newly downloaded firmware image the active image, which
     will be used by the switch during the next restart.
     This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.
     The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results'
     that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the
     playbook is run.
