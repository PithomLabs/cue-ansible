notes:
    - Either C(sysmtu) param is required or C(interface) AND C(mtu) params are req'd.
    - C(state=absent) unconfigures a given MTU if that value is currently present.
    - Recommended connection is C(network_cli).
    - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
