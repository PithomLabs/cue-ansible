module: postgresql_lang
short_description: Adds, removes or changes procedural languages with a PostgreSQL database
description:
- Adds, removes or changes procedural languages with a PostgreSQL database.
- This module allows you to add a language, remote a language or change the trust
  relationship with a PostgreSQL database.
- The module can be used on the machine where executed or on a remote host.
- When removing a language from a database, it is possible that dependencies prevent
  the database from being removed. In that case, you can specify I(cascade=yes) to
  automatically drop objects that depend on the language (such as functions in the
  language).
- In case the language can't be deleted because it is required by the
  database system, you can specify I(fail_on_drop=no) to ignore the error.
- Be careful when marking a language as trusted since this could be a potential
  security breach. Untrusted languages allow only users with the PostgreSQL superuser
  privilege to use this language to create new functions.
