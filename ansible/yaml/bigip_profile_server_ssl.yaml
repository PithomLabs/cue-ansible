description:
  - Manages server SSL profiles on a BIG-IP.
version_added: 2.8
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the profile.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed.
    type: str
    default: /Common/serverssl
  ciphers:
    description:
      - Specifies the list of ciphers that the system supports. When creating a new
        profile, the default cipher list is provided by the parent profile.
    type: str
  secure_renegotiation:
    description:
      - Specifies the method of secure renegotiations for SSL connections. When
        creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.
      - When C(request) is set the system request secure renegotation of SSL
        connections.
      - C(require) is a default setting and when set the system permits initial SSL
        handshakes from clients but terminates renegotiations from unpatched clients.
      - The C(require-strict) setting the system requires strict renegotiation of SSL
        connections. In this mode the system refuses connections to insecure servers,
        and terminates existing SSL connections to insecure servers.
    type: str
    choices:
      - require
      - require-strict
      - request
  server_name:
    description:
      - Specifies the fully qualified DNS hostname of the server used in Server Name
        Indication communications. When creating a new profile, the setting is provided
        by the parent profile.
    type: str
  sni_default:
    description:
      - Indicates that the system uses this profile as the default SSL profile when there
        is no match to the server name, or when the client provides no SNI extension support.
      - When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.
      - There can be only one SSL profile with this setting enabled.
    type: bool
  sni_require:
    description:
      - Requires that the network peers also provide SNI support, setting only takes
        effect when C(sni_default) is C(yes).
      - When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.
    type: bool
  server_certificate:
    description:
      - Specifies the way the system handles server certificates.
      - When C(ignore), specifies that the system ignores certificates from server systems.
      - When C(require), specifies that the system requires a server to present a valid
        certificate.
    type: str
    choices:
      - ignore
      - require
  certificate:
    description:

    description:
