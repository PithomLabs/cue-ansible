module: gcp_tpu_node
description:
- A Cloud TPU instance.
short_description: Creates a GCP Node
version_added: '2.9'
author: Google Inc. (@googlecloudplatform)
requirements:
- python >= 2.6
- requests >= 2.18.4
- google-auth >= 1.3.0
options:
  state:
    description:
    - Whether the given object should exist in GCP
    choices:
    - present
    - absent
    default: present
    type: str
  name:
    description:
    - The immutable name of the TPU.
    required: true
    type: str
  description:
    description:
    - The user-supplied description of the TPU. Maximum of 512 characters.
    required: false
    type: str
  accelerator_type:
    description:
    - The type of hardware accelerators associated with this node.
    required: true
    type: str
  tensorflow_version:
    description:
    - The version of Tensorflow running in the Node.
    required: true
    type: str
  network:
    description:
    - The name of a network to peer the TPU node to. It must be a preexisting Compute
      Engine network inside of the project on which this API has been activated. If
      none is provided, "default" will be used.
    required: false
    type: str
  cidr_block:
    description:
    - The CIDR block that the TPU node will use when selecting an IP address. This
      CIDR block must be a /29 block; the Compute Engine networks API forbids a smaller
      block, and using a larger block would be wasteful (a node can only consume one
      IP address).
    - Errors will occur if the CIDR block has already been used for a currently existing
      TPU node, the CIDR block conflicts with any subnetworks in the user's provided
      network, or the provided network is peered with another network that is using
      that CIDR block.
    required: true
