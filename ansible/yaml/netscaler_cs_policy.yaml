                If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for
                example, my policy or my policy).
            - "Minimum length = 1"

    url:
        description:
            - >-
                URL string that is matched with the URL of a request. Can contain a wildcard character. Specify the
                string value in the following format: C([[prefix] [*]] [.suffix]).
            - "Minimum length = 1"
            - "Maximum length = 208"

    rule:
        description:
            - >-
                Expression, or name of a named expression, against which traffic is evaluated. Written in the classic
                or default syntax.
            - "Note:"
            - >-
                Maximum length of a string literal in the expression is 255 characters. A longer string can be split
                into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the +
                operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"<string of 255
                characters>" + "<string of 245 characters>"'

                Content switching action that names the target load balancing virtual server to which the traffic is
                switched.
