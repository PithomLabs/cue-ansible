    state:
        description:
          - Whether the snapshot should exist or not. I(rebooted) is not idempotent and will leave the DB instance in a running state
            and start it prior to rebooting if it was stopped. I(present) will leave the DB instance in the current running/stopped state,
            (running if creating the DB instance).
          - I(state=running) and I(state=started) are synonyms, as are I(state=rebooted) and I(state=restarted). Note - rebooting the instance
            is not idempotent.
        choices: ['present', 'absent', 'terminated', 'running', 'started', 'stopped', 'rebooted', 'restarted']
        default: 'present'
        type: str
    creation_source:
        description: Which source to use if restoring from a template (an existing instance, S3 bucket, or snapshot).
        choices: ['snapshot', 's3', 'instance']
        type: str
    force_update_password:
        description:
          - Set to True to update your cluster password with I(master_user_password). Since comparing passwords to determine
            if it needs to be updated is not possible this is set to False by default to allow idempotence.
        type: bool
        default: False
    purge_cloudwatch_logs_exports:
        description: Set to False to retain any enabled cloudwatch logs that aren't specified in the task and are associated with the instance.
        type: bool
        default: True
    purge_tags:
        description: Set to False to retain any tags that aren't specified in task and are associated with the instance.
        type: bool
        default: True
    read_replica:
        description:
          - Set to False to promote a read replica cluster or true to create one. When creating a read replica C(creation_source) should
            be set to 'instance' or not provided. C(source_db_instance_identifier) must be provided with this option.
        type: bool
    wait:
        description:
          - Whether to wait for the cluster to be available, stopped, or deleted. At a later time a wait_timeout option may be added.
            Following each API call to create/modify/delete the instance a waiter is used with a 60 second delay 30 times until the instance reaches
            the expected state (available/stopped/deleted). The total task time may also be influenced by AWSRetry which helps stabilize if the
            instance is in an invalid state to operate on to begin with (such as if you try to stop it when it is in the process of rebooting).
            If setting this to False task retries and delays may make your playbook execution better handle timeouts for major modifications.
