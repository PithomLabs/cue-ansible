    state:
        description:
            - C(Started)/C(stopped) are idempotent actions that will not run
              commands unless necessary.  C(restarted) will always bounce the
              svc (svc -t) and C(killed) will always bounce the svc (svc -k).
              C(reloaded) will send a sigusr1 (svc -1).
              C(once) will run a normally downed svc once (svc -o), not really
              an idempotent operation.

        choices: [ killed, once, reloaded, restarted, started, stopped ]
    downed:
        description:
            - Should a 'down' file exist or not, if it exists it disables auto startup.
              Defaults to no. Downed does not imply stopped.
        type: bool
        default: no
    enabled:
        description:
            - Whether the service is enabled or not, if disabled it also implies stopped.
              Take note that a service can be enabled and downed (no auto restart).
