            - Enable or disable IPv4 network interface configuration.
            - Either IPv4 or IPv6 must be enabled otherwise error will occur.
            - Only required when enabling or disabling IPv4 network interface

    controller:
        description:
            - The controller that owns the port you want to configure.
            - Controller names are represented alphabetically, with the first controller as A,
             the second as B, and so on.
            - Current hardware models have either 1 or 2 available controllers, but that is not a guaranteed hard
             limitation and could change in the future.

            - The port to modify the configuration for.
            - The list of choices is not necessarily comprehensive. It depends on the number of ports
              that are present in the system.
            - The name represents the port number (typically from left to right on the controller),
              beginning with a value of 1.
            - Mutually exclusive with I(channel).

        description:
            - Enable ssh access to the controller for debug purposes.
            - This is a controller-level setting.
            - rlogin/telnet will be enabled for ancient equipment where ssh is not available.
        required: no

        description:
            - A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        required: no
notes:
    - Check mode is supported.
    - The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address
      via dhcp, etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
    - "Known issue: Changes specifically to down ports will result in a failure. However, this may not be the case in up
      coming NetApp E-Series firmware releases (released after firmware version 11.40.2)."
