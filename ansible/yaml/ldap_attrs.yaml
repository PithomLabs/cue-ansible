short_description: Add or remove multiple LDAP attribute values
description:
  - Add or remove multiple LDAP attribute values.
notes:
  - This only deals with attributes on existing entries. To add or remove
    whole entries, see M(ldap_entry).
  - The default authentication settings will attempt to use a SASL EXTERNAL
    bind over a UNIX domain socket. This works well with the default Ubuntu
    install for example, which includes a cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth ACL
    rule allowing root to modify the server configuration. If you need to use
    a simple bind to access your server, pass the credentials in I(bind_dn)
    and I(bind_pw).
  - For I(state=present) and I(state=absent), all value comparisons are
    performed on the server for maximum accuracy. For I(state=exact), values
    have to be compared in Python, which obviously ignores LDAP matching
    rules. This should work out in most cases, but it is theoretically
    possible to see spurious changes when target and actual values are
    semantically identical but lexically distinct.

requirements:
  - python-ldap
options:
  state:
    required: false
    type: str
    choices: [present, absent, exact]
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the attribute values. If C(present), all given attribute
        values will be added if they're missing. If C(absent), all given
        attribute values will be removed if present. If C(exact), the set of
        attribute values will be forced to exactly those provided and no others.
        If I(state=exact) and the attribute I(value) is empty, all values for
        this attribute will be removed.
  attributes:
    required: true
    type: dict
    description:
      - The attribute(s) and value(s) to add or remove. The complex argument format is required in order to pass
        a list of strings (see examples).
  ordered:
    required: false
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - If C(yes), prepend list values with X-ORDERED index numbers in all
        attributes specified in the current task. This is useful mostly with
        I(olcAccess) attribute to easily manage LDAP Access Control Lists.
