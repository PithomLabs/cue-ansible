short_description: Manage the trust relationships between BIG-IPs
description:
  - Manage the trust relationships between BIG-IPs. Devices, once peered, cannot
    be updated. If updating is needed, the peer must first be removed before it
    can be re-added to the trust.
version_added: 2.5
options:
  peer_server:
    description:
      - The peer address to connect to and trust for synchronizing configuration.
        This is typically the management address of the remote device, but may
        also be a Self IP.
    type: str
    required: True
  peer_hostname:
    description:
      - The hostname that you want to associate with the device. This value will
        be used to easily distinguish this device in BIG-IP configuration.
      - When trusting a new device, if this parameter is not specified, the value
        of C(peer_server) will be used as a default.
    type: str
  peer_user:
    description:
      - The API username of the remote peer device that you are trusting. Note
        that the CLI user cannot be used unless it too has an API account. If this
        value is not specified, then the value of C(user), or the environment
        variable C(F5_USER) will be used.
    type: str
  peer_password:
    description:
      - The password of the API username of the remote peer device that you are
        trusting. If this value is not specified, then the value of C(password),
        or the environment variable C(F5_PASSWORD) will be used.
    type: str
  type:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the device you are adding is a Peer or a Subordinate.
        The default is C(peer).
      - The difference between the two is a matter of mitigating risk of
        compromise.
      - A subordinate device cannot sign a certificate for another device.
      - In the case where the security of an authority device in a trust domain
        is compromised, the risk of compromise is minimized for any subordinate
        device.
      - Designating devices as subordinate devices is recommended for device
        groups with a large number of member devices, where the risk of compromise
        is high.
    type: str
    choices:
      - peer
      - subordinate
    default: peer
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures the specified devices are trusted.
      - When C(absent), removes the device trusts.
    type: str
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
    default: present
