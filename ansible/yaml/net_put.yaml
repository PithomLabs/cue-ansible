notes:
   - Some devices need specific configurations to be enabled before scp can work
     These configuration should be pre-configured before using this module
     e.g ios - C(ip scp server enable).
   - User privilege to do scp on network device should be pre-configured
     e.g. ios - need user privilege 15 by default for allowing scp.
   - Default destination of source file.
