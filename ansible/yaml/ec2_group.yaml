    description:
      - List of firewall inbound rules to enforce in this group (see example). If none are supplied,

        This allows idempotent loopback additions (e.g. allow group to access itself).
        Rule sources list support was added in version 2.4. This allows to define multiple sources per
        source type as well as multiple source types per rule. Prior to 2.4 an individual source is allowed.
        In version 2.5 support for rule descriptions was added.

notes:
  - If a rule declares a group_name and that group doesn't exist, it will be
    automatically created. In that case, group_desc should be provided as well.
    The module will refuse to create a depended-on group without a description.
  - Preview diff mode support is added in version 2.7.
