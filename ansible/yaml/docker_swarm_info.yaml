short_description: Retrieves facts about Docker Swarm cluster.

description:
  - Retrieves facts about a Docker Swarm.
  - Returns lists of swarm objects names for the services - nodes, services, tasks.
  - The output differs depending on API version available on docker host.
  - Must be run on Swarm Manager node; otherwise module fails with error message.
    It does return boolean flags in on both error and success which indicate whether
    the docker daemon can be communicated with, whether it is in Swarm mode, and
    whether it is a Swarm Manager node.
