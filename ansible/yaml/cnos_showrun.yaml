short_description: Collect the current running configuration on devices running on CNOS
description:
    - This module allows you to view the switch running configuration. It
     executes the display running-config CLI command on a switch and returns a
     file containing the current running configuration of the target network
     device. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.
     The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results'
     that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the
     playbook is run.
