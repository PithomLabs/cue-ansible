module: bigip_device_group_member
short_description: Manages members in a device group
description:
  - Manages members in a device group. Members in a device group can only
    be added or removed, never updated. This is because the members are
    identified by unique name values and changing that name would invalidate
    the uniqueness.

    description:
      - Specifies the name of the device that you want to add to the
        device group. Often this will be the hostname of the device.
        This member must be trusted by the device already. Trusting
        can be done with the C(bigip_device_trust) module and the
        C(peer_hostname) option to that module.
