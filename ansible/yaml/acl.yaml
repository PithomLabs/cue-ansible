notes:
- The C(acl) module requires that ACLs are enabled on the target filesystem and that the C(setfacl) and C(getfacl) binaries are installed.
- As of Ansible 2.0, this module only supports Linux distributions.
- As of Ansible 2.3, the I(name) option has been changed to I(path) as default, but I(name) still works as well.
