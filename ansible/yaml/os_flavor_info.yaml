module: os_flavor_info
short_description: Retrieve information about one or more flavors
author: "David Shrewsbury (@Shrews)"
version_added: "2.1"
description:
    - Retrieve information about available OpenStack instance flavors. By default,
      information about ALL flavors are retrieved. Filters can be applied to get
      information for only matching flavors. For example, you can filter on the
      amount of RAM available to the flavor, or the number of virtual CPUs
      available to the flavor, or both. When specifying multiple filters,
      *ALL* filters must match on a flavor before that flavor is returned as
      a fact.
    - This module was called C(os_flavor_facts) before Ansible 2.9, returning C(ansible_facts).
      Note that the M(os_flavor_info) module no longer returns C(ansible_facts)!
notes:
    - The result contains a list of unsorted flavors.
requirements:
    - "python >= 2.7"
    - "openstacksdk"
options:
   name:
     description:
       - A flavor name. Cannot be used with I(ram) or I(vcpus) or I(ephemeral).
   ram:
     description:
       - "A string used for filtering flavors based on the amount of RAM
         (in MB) desired. This string accepts the following special values:
         'MIN' (return flavors with the minimum amount of RAM), and 'MAX'
         (return flavors with the maximum amount of RAM)."

       - "A specific amount of RAM may also be specified. Any flavors with this
         exact amount of RAM will be returned."

       - "A range of acceptable RAM may be given using a special syntax. Simply
         prefix the amount of RAM with one of these acceptable range values:
         '<', '>', '<=', '>='. These values represent less than, greater than,
         less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, respectively."

   vcpus:
     description:
       - A string used for filtering flavors based on the number of virtual
         CPUs desired. Format is the same as the I(ram) parameter.
     type: bool
     default: 'no'
   limit:
     description:
       - Limits the number of flavors returned. All matching flavors are
         returned by default.
   ephemeral:
     description:
       - A string used for filtering flavors based on the amount of ephemeral
         storage. Format is the same as the I(ram) parameter
