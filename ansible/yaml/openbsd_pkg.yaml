    state:
        description:
          - C(present) will make sure the package is installed.
            C(latest) will make sure the latest version of the package is installed.

        choices: [ absent, latest, present ]
        default: present
    build:
        description:
          - Build the package from source instead of downloading and installing
            a binary. Requires that the port source tree is already installed.
            Automatically builds and installs the 'sqlports' package, if it is
            not already installed.
        type: bool
        default: 'no'
        version_added: "2.1"
    ports_dir:
        description:
          - When used in combination with the C(build) option, allows overriding
            the default ports source directory.
        default: /usr/ports
        version_added: "2.1"
    clean:
        description:
          - When updating or removing packages, delete the extra configuration
            file(s) in the old packages which are annotated with @extra in
            the packaging-list.
        type: bool
        default: 'no'
        version_added: "2.3"
    quick:
        description:
          - Replace or delete packages quickly; do not bother with checksums
            before removing normal files.
        type: bool
        default: 'no'
        version_added: "2.3"
notes:
  - When used with a `loop:` each package will be processed individually,
    it is much more efficient to pass the list directly to the `name` option.
