module: docker_image

short_description: Manage docker images.

version_added: "1.5"

description:
  - Build, load or pull an image, making the image available for creating containers. Also supports tagging an
    image into a repository and archiving an image to a .tar file.
  - Since Ansible 2.8, it is recommended to explicitly specify the image's source (I(source) can be C(build),
    C(load), C(pull) or C(local)). This will be required from Ansible 2.12 on.

options:
  source:
    description:
      - "Determines where the module will try to retrieve the image from."
      - "Use C(build) to build the image from a C(Dockerfile). I(build.path) must
         be specified when this value is used."
      - "Use C(load) to load the image from a C(.tar) file. I(load_path) must
         be specified when this value is used."
      - "Use C(pull) to pull the image from a registry."
      - "Use C(local) to make sure that the image is already available on the local
         docker daemon, i.e. do not try to build, pull or load the image."
      - "Before Ansible 2.12, the value of this option will be auto-detected
         to be backwards compatible, but a warning will be issued if it is not
         explicitly specified. From Ansible 2.12 on, auto-detection will be disabled
         and this option will be made mandatory."

        matching the provided name.
      - When C(present) check if an image exists using the provided name and tag. If the image is not found or the
        force option is used, the image will either be pulled, built or loaded, depending on the I(source) option.
      - By default the image will be pulled from Docker Hub, or the registry specified in the image's name. Note that
        this will change in Ansible 2.12, so to make sure that you are pulling, set I(source) to C(pull). To build
        the image, provide a I(path) value set to a directory containing a context and Dockerfile, and set I(source)
        to C(build). To load an image, specify I(load_path) to provide a path to an archive file. To tag an image to
        a repository, provide a I(repository) path. If the name contains a repository path, it will be pushed.
