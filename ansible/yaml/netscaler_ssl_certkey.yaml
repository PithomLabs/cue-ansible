    certkey:
        description:
            - >-
                Name for the certificate and private-key pair. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore
                C(_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore C(_), hash C(#), period C(.), space C( ),
                colon C(:), at C(@), equals C(=), and hyphen C(-) characters. Cannot be changed after the certificate-key
                pair is created.

                If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for
                example, "my cert" or 'my cert').

    cert:
        description:
            - >-
                Name of and, optionally, path to the X509 certificate file that is used to form the certificate-key
                pair. The certificate file should be present on the appliance's hard-disk drive or solid-state drive.
                Storing a certificate in any location other than the default might cause inconsistency in a high
                availability setup. /nsconfig/ssl/ is the default path.
            - "Minimum length = 1"

    key:
        description:
            - >-
                Name of and, optionally, path to the private-key file that is used to form the certificate-key pair.

    password:
        description:
            - >-
                Passphrase that was used to encrypt the private-key. Use this option to load encrypted private-keys
                in PEM format.

    inform:
        choices:
            - 'DER'
            - 'PEM'
            - 'PFX'
        description:
            - >-
                Input format of the certificate and the private-key files. The three formats supported by the
                appliance are:
            - "PEM - Privacy Enhanced Mail"
            - "DER - Distinguished Encoding Rule"
            - "PFX - Personal Information Exchange."

    passplain:
        description:
            - >-
                Pass phrase used to encrypt the private-key. Required when adding an encrypted private-key in PEM
                format.

    notificationperiod:
        description:
            - >-
                Time, in number of days, before certificate expiration, at which to generate an alert that the
                certificate is about to expire.
