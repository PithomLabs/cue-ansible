short_description: Add or remove a database on Webfaction
description:
    - Add or remove a database on a Webfaction host. Further documentation at https://github.com/quentinsf/ansible-webfaction.
author: Quentin Stafford-Fraser (@quentinsf)
version_added: "2.0"
notes:
    - >
      You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the remote webfaction API.
      The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts I(simultaneously) is best avoided. If you don't specify I(localhost) as
      your host, you may want to add C(serial: 1) to the plays.
    - See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.
