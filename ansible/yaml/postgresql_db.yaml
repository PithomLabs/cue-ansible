  state:
    description:
    - The database state.
    - C(present) implies that the database should be created if necessary.
    - C(absent) implies that the database should be removed if present.
    - C(dump) requires a target definition to which the database will be backed up. (Added in Ansible 2.4)
      Note that in some PostgreSQL versions of pg_dump, which is an embedded PostgreSQL utility and is used by the module,
      returns rc 0 even when errors occurred (e.g. the connection is forbidden by pg_hba.conf, etc.),
      so the module returns changed=True but the dump has not actually been done. Please, be sure that your version of
      pg_dump returns rc 1 in this case.
    - C(restore) also requires a target definition from which the database will be restored. (Added in Ansible 2.4)
    - The format of the backup will be detected based on the target name.
    - Supported compression formats for dump and restore include C(.pgc), C(.bz2), C(.gz) and C(.xz)
    - Supported formats for dump and restore include C(.sql) and C(.tar)
