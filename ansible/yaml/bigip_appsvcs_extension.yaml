module: bigip_appsvcs_extension
short_description: Manage application service deployments
description:
  - Manages application service deployments via the App Services Extension functionality
    in BIG-IP.
version_added: 2.7
options:
  content:
    description:
      - Declaration of tenants configured on the system.
      - This parameter is most often used along with the C(file) or C(template) lookup plugins.
        Refer to the examples section for correct usage.
      - For anything advanced or with formatting consider using the C(template) lookup.
      - This can additionally be used for specifying application service configurations
        directly in YAML, however that is not an encouraged practice and, if used at all,
        should only be used for the absolute smallest of configurations to prevent your
        Playbooks from becoming too large.
      - If you C(content) includes encrypted values (such as ciphertexts, passphrases, etc),
        the returned C(changed) value will always be true.
      - If you are using the C(to_nice_json) filter, it will cause this module to fail because
        the purpose of that filter is to format the JSON to be human-readable and this process
        includes inserting "extra characters that break JSON validators.
    type: raw
    required: True
  tenants:
    description:
      - A list of tenants that you want to remove.
      - This parameter is only relevant when C(state) is C(absent). It will be ignored when
        C(state) is C(present).
      - A value of C(all) will remove all tenants.
      - Tenants can be specified as a list as well to remove only specific tenants.
    type: raw
  force:
    description:
      - Force updates a declaration.
      - This parameter should be used in cases where your declaration includes items that
        are encrypted or in cases (such as WAF Policies) where you want a large reload to take place.
    type: bool
    default: no
  state:
    description:
      - When C(state) is C(present), ensures the configuration exists.
      - When C(state) is C(absent), ensures that the configuration is removed.
    type: str
