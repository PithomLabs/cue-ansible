description:
    - Manages "spells" on Source Mage GNU/Linux using I(sorcery) toolchain
author: "Vlad Glagolev (@vaygr)"
version_added: "2.3"
notes:
    - When all three components are selected, the update goes by the sequence --
      Sorcery -> Grimoire(s) -> Spell(s); you cannot override it.
    - grimoire handling (i.e. add/remove, including SCM/rsync versions) is not
      yet supported.
requirements:
    - bash
options:
    name:
        description:
            - Name of the spell
            - multiple names can be given, separated by commas
            - special value '*' in conjunction with states C(latest) or
              C(rebuild) will update or rebuild the whole system respectively
        aliases: ["spell"]

    state:
        description:
            - Whether to cast, dispel or rebuild a package
            - state C(cast) is an equivalent of C(present), not C(latest)
            - state C(latest) always triggers C(update_cache=yes)
            - state C(rebuild) implies cast of all specified spells, not only
              those existed before
        choices: ["present", "latest", "absent", "cast", "dispelled", "rebuild"]
        default: "present"

    depends:
        description:
            - Comma-separated list of _optional_ dependencies to build a spell
              (or make sure it is built) with; use +/- in front of dependency
              to turn it on/off ('+' is optional though)
            - this option is ignored if C(name) parameter is equal to '*' or
              contains more than one spell
            - providers must be supplied in the form recognized by Sorcery, e.g.
              'openssl(SSL)'

    update:
        description:
            - Whether or not to update sorcery scripts at the very first stage
        type: bool
        default: 'no'

    update_cache:
        description:
            - Whether or not to update grimoire collection before casting spells
        type: bool
        default: 'no'
        aliases: ["update_codex"]

    cache_valid_time:
        description:
            - Time in seconds to invalidate grimoire collection on update
            - especially useful for SCM and rsync grimoires
            - makes sense only in pair with C(update_cache)
