short_description: Manipulate entries in the key/value store of a consul cluster
description:
  - Allows the retrieval, addition, modification and deletion of key/value entries in a
    consul cluster via the agent. The entire contents of the record, including
    the indices, flags and session are returned as C(value).
  - If the C(key) represents a prefix then note that when a value is removed, the existing
    value if any is returned as part of the results.
  - See http://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html#kv for more details.

          - The action to take with the supplied key and value. If the state is 'present' and `value` is set, the key
            contents will be set to the value supplied and `changed` will be set to `true` only if the value was
            different to the current contents. If the state is 'present' and `value` is not set, the existing value
            associated to the key will be returned. The state 'absent' will remove the key/value pair,
            again 'changed' will be set to true only if the key actually existed
            prior to the removal. An attempt can be made to obtain or free the
            lock associated with a key/value pair with the states 'acquire' or
            'release' respectively. a valid session must be supplied to make the
            attempt changed will be true if the attempt is successful, false
            otherwise.
