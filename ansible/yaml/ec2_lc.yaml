short_description: Create or delete AWS Autoscaling Launch Configurations

description:
  - Can create or delete AWS Autoscaling Configurations.
  - Works with the ec2_asg module to manage Autoscaling Groups.

notes:
  - Amazon ASG Autoscaling Launch Configurations are immutable once created, so modifying the configuration after it is changed will not modify the
    launch configuration on AWS. You must create a new config and assign it to the ASG instead.
  - encrypted volumes are supported on versions >= 2.4

version_added: "1.6"
