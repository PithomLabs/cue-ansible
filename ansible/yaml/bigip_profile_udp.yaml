module: bigip_profile_udp
short_description: Manage UDP profiles on a BIG-IP
description:
  - Manage UDP profiles on a BIG-IP. Many of UDP profiles exist; each with their
    own adjustments to the standard C(udp) profile. Users of this module should be aware
    that many of the adjustable knobs have no module default. Instead, the default is
    assigned by the BIG-IP system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.
version_added: 2.6
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the profile.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        is the system-supplied C(udp) profile.
    type: str
  idle_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before
        the connection is eligible for deletion.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote
        device will choose a default value appropriate for the profile, based on its
        C(parent) profile.
      - When a number is specified, indicates the number of seconds that the UDP
        connection can remain idle before the system deletes it.
      - When C(0), or C(indefinite), specifies that UDP connections can remain idle
        indefinitely.
      - When C(immediate), specifies that you do not want the UDP connection to
        remain idle, and that it is therefore immediately eligible for deletion.
    type: str
  datagram_load_balancing:
    description:
      - Specifies, when C(yes), that the system load balances UDP traffic
        packet-by-packet.
    type: bool
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the profile exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the profile is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
