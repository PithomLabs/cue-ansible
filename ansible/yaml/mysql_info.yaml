    description:
    - Limit the collected information by comma separated string or YAML list.
    - Allowable values are C(version), C(databases), C(settings), C(global_status),
      C(users), C(engines), C(master_status), C(slave_status), C(slave_hosts).
    - By default, collects all subsets.
    - You can use '!' before value (for example, C(!settings)) to exclude it from the information.
    - If you pass including and excluding values to the filter, for example, I(filter=!settings,version),
      the excluding values, C(!settings) in this case, will be ignored.
