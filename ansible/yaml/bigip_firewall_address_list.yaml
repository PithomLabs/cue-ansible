    description:
      - Description of the address list
    type: str
  geo_locations:
    description:
      - List of geolocations specified by their C(country) and C(region).
    suboptions:
      country:
        description:
          - The country name, or code, of the geolocation to use.
          - In addition to the country full names, you may also specify their abbreviated
            form, such as C(US) instead of C(United States).
          - Valid country codes can be found here https://countrycode.org/.
        type: str
        required: True
        choices:
          - Any valid 2 character ISO country code.
          - Any valid country name.
      region:
        description:
          - Region name of the country to use.
        type: str
    type: list
  addresses:
    description:
      - Individual addresses that you want to add to the list. These addresses differ
        from ranges, and lists of lists such as what can be used in C(address_ranges)
        and C(address_lists) respectively.
      - This list can also include networks that have CIDR notation.
    type: list
  address_ranges:
    description:
      - A list of address ranges where the range starts with a port number, is followed
        by a dash (-) and then a second number.
      - If the first address is greater than the second number, the numbers will be
        reversed so-as to be properly formatted. ie, C(2.2.2.2-1.1.1). would become
        C(1.1.1.1-2.2.2.2).
    type: list
  address_lists:
    description:
      - Simple list of existing address lists to add to this list. Address lists can be
        specified in either their fully qualified name (/Common/foo) or their short
        name (foo). If a short name is used, the C(partition) argument will automatically
        be prepended to the short name.
    type: list
  fqdns:
    description:
      - A list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
      - An FQDN has at least one decimal point in it, separating the host from the domain.
      - To add FQDNs to a list requires that a global FQDN resolver be configured.
        At the moment, this must either be done via C(bigip_command), or, in the GUI
        of BIG-IP. If using C(bigip_command), this can be done with C(tmsh modify security
        firewall global-fqdn-policy FOO) where C(FOO) is a DNS resolver configured
        at C(tmsh create net dns-resolver FOO).
    type: list
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the address list and entries exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the address list is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
