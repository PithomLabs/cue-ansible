module: panos_security_rule
short_description: Create security rule policy on PAN-OS devices or Panorama management console.
description:
    - Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed.
      The policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches the traffic is applied,
      the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.
