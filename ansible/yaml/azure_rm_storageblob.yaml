            - Use state C(absent) with a container value only to delete a container. Include a blob value to remove
              a specific blob. A container will not be deleted, if it contains blobs. Use the I(force) option to override,
              deleting the container and all associated blobs.
            - Use state C(present) to create or update a container and upload or download a blob. If the container
              does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, it will be updated with configuration options. Provide
              a blob name and either src or dest to upload or download. Provide a src path to upload and a dest path
              to download. If a blob (uploading) or a file (downloading) already exists, it will not be overwritten
              unless I(force=true).
