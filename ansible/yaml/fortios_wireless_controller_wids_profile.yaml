module: fortios_wireless_controller_wids_profile
short_description: Configure wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) profiles in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify wireless_controller feature and wids_profile category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.5
version_added: "2.8"
