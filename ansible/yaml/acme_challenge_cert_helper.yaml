description:
   - "Prepares certificates for ACME challenges such as C(tls-alpn-01)."
   - "The raw data is provided by the M(acme_certificate) module, and needs to be
      converted to a certificate to be used for challenge validation. This module
      provides a simple way to generate the required certificates."
   - "The C(tls-alpn-01) implementation is based on
      L(the draft-05 version of the specification,https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-tls-alpn-05)."
