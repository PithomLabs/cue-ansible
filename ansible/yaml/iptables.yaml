short_description: Modify iptables rules
version_added: "2.0"

description:
  - C(iptables) is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet
    filter rules in the Linux kernel.
  - This module does not handle the saving and/or loading of rules, but rather
    only manipulates the current rules that are present in memory. This is the
    same as the behaviour of the C(iptables) and C(ip6tables) command which
    this module uses internally.
notes:
  - This module just deals with individual rules.If you need advanced
    chaining of rules the recommended way is to template the iptables restore
    file.
options:
  table:
    description:
      - This option specifies the packet matching table which the command should operate on.
      - If the kernel is configured with automatic module loading, an attempt will be made
         to load the appropriate module for that table if it is not already there.
    type: str
    choices: [ filter, nat, mangle, raw, security ]
    default: filter
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the rule should be absent or present.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: present
  action:
    description:
      - Whether the rule should be appended at the bottom or inserted at the top.
      - If the rule already exists the chain will not be modified.
    type: str
    choices: [ append, insert ]
    default: append
    version_added: "2.2"
  rule_num:
    description:
      - Insert the rule as the given rule number.
      - This works only with C(action=insert).
    type: str
    version_added: "2.5"
  ip_version:
    description:
      - Which version of the IP protocol this rule should apply to.
    type: str
    choices: [ ipv4, ipv6 ]
    default: ipv4
  chain:
    description:
      - Specify the iptables chain to modify.
      - This could be a user-defined chain or one of the standard iptables chains, like
        C(INPUT), C(FORWARD), C(OUTPUT), C(PREROUTING), C(POSTROUTING), C(SECMARK) or C(CONNSECMARK).
    type: str
  protocol:
    description:
      - The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.
      - The specified protocol can be one of C(tcp), C(udp), C(udplite), C(icmp), C(esp),
        C(ah), C(sctp) or the special keyword C(all), or it can be a numeric value,
        representing one of these protocols or a different one.
      - A protocol name from I(/etc/protocols) is also allowed.
      - A C(!) argument before the protocol inverts the test.
      - The number zero is equivalent to all.
      - C(all) will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is omitted.
    type: str
  source:
    description:
      - Source specification.
      - Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address
        (with /mask), or a plain IP address.
      - Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to
        the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with
        a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea.
      - The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying
        the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask
        of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A C(!) argument before the
        address specification inverts the sense of the address.
    type: str
  destination:
    description:
      - Destination specification.
      - Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address
        (with /mask), or a plain IP address.
      - Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to
        the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with
        a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea.
      - The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying
        the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask
        of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A C(!) argument before the
        address specification inverts the sense of the address.
    type: str
  tcp_flags:
    description:
      - TCP flags specification.
      - C(tcp_flags) expects a dict with the two keys C(flags) and C(flags_set).
    type: dict
    default: {}
    version_added: "2.4"
    suboptions:
        flags:
            description:
                - List of flags you want to examine.
            type: list
        flags_set:
            description:
                - Flags to be set.
            type: list
  match:
    description:
      - Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that tests for
        a specific property.
      - The set of matches make up the condition under which a target is invoked.
      - Matches are evaluated first to last if specified as an array and work in short-circuit
        fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false, evaluation will stop.
    type: list
    default: []
  jump:
    description:
      - This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet matches it.
      - The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the one
        this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide the
        fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS
        below).
      - If this option is omitted in a rule (and the goto parameter
        is not used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the
        packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.
    type: str
  gateway:
    description:
      - This specifies the IP address of host to send the cloned packets.
      - This option is only valid when C(jump) is set to C(TEE).
    type: str
    version_added: "2.8"
  log_prefix:
    description:
      - Specifies a log text for the rule. Only make sense with a LOG jump.
    type: str
    version_added: "2.5"
  log_level:
    description:
      - Logging level according to the syslogd-defined priorities.
      - The value can be strings or numbers from 1-8.
      - This parameter is only applicable if C(jump) is set to C(LOG).
    type: str
    version_added: "2.8"
    choices: [ '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', 'emerg', 'alert', 'crit', 'error', 'warning', 'notice', 'info', 'debug' ]
  goto:
    description:
      - This specifies that the processing should continue in a user specified chain.
      - Unlike the jump argument return will not continue processing in
        this chain but instead in the chain that called us via jump.
    type: str
  in_interface:
    description:
      - Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets
        entering the C(INPUT), C(FORWARD) and C(PREROUTING) chains).
      - When the C(!) argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted.
      - If the interface name ends in a C(+), then any interface which begins with
        this name will match.
      - If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
    type: str
  out_interface:
    description:
      - Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for
        packets entering the C(FORWARD), C(OUTPUT) and C(POSTROUTING) chains).
      - When the C(!) argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted.
      - If the interface name ends in a C(+), then any interface which begins
        with this name will match.
      - If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
    type: str
  fragment:
    description:
      - This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments
        of fragmented packets.
      - Since there is no way to tell the source or destination ports of such
        a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any rules which specify them.
      - When the "!" argument precedes fragment argument, the rule will only match head fragments,
        or unfragmented packets.
    type: str
  set_counters:
    description:
      - This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
        counters of a rule (during C(INSERT), C(APPEND), C(REPLACE) operations).
    type: str
  source_port:
    description:
      - Source port or port range specification.
      - This can either be a service name or a port number.
      - An inclusive range can also be specified, using the format C(first:last).
      - If the first port is omitted, C(0) is assumed; if the last is omitted, C(65535) is assumed.
      - If the first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
    type: str
  destination_port:
    description:
      - "Destination port or port range specification. This can either be
        a service name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be
        specified, using the format first:last. If the first port is omitted,
        '0' is assumed; if the last is omitted, '65535' is assumed. If the
        first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
        This is only valid if the rule also specifies one of the following
        protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp."
    type: str
  to_ports:
    description:
      - This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use, without
        this, the destination port is never altered.

        C(tcp), C(udp), C(dccp) or C(sctp).
    type: str
  to_destination:
    description:
      - This specifies a destination address to use with C(DNAT).

  syn:
    description:
      - This allows matching packets that have the SYN bit set and the ACK
        and RST bits unset.
      - When negated, this matches all packets with the RST or the ACK bits set.
    type: str
    choices: [ ignore, match, negate ]
    default: ignore
    version_added: "2.5"
  set_dscp_mark:
    description:
      - This allows specifying a DSCP mark to be added to packets.
        It takes either an integer or hex value.
      - Mutually exclusive with C(set_dscp_mark_class).
    type: str
    version_added: "2.1"
  set_dscp_mark_class:
    description:
      - This allows specifying a predefined DiffServ class which will be
        translated to the corresponding DSCP mark.
      - Mutually exclusive with C(set_dscp_mark).
    type: str

    type: str
    version_added: "2.8"
  limit:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum average number of matches to allow per second.
      - The number can specify units explicitly, using `/second', `/minute',
        `/hour' or `/day', or parts of them (so `5/second' is the same as
        `5/s').
    type: str
  limit_burst:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum burst before the above limit kicks in.
    type: str
