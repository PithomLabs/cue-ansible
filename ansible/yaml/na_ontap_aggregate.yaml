  disk_count:
    description:
    - Number of disks to place into the aggregate, including parity disks.
    - The disks in this newly-created aggregate come from the spare disk pool.
    - The smallest disks in this pool join the aggregate first, unless the C(disk-size) argument is provided.
    - Either C(disk-count) or C(disks) must be supplied. Range [0..2^31-1].
    - Required when C(state=present).

  disk_size:

  disks:
    type: list
    description:
    - Specific list of disks to use for the new aggregate.
