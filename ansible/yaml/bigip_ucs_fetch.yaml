module: bigip_ucs_fetch
short_description: Fetches a UCS file from remote nodes
description:
   - This module is used for fetching UCS files from remote machines and
     storing them locally in a file tree, organized by hostname. Note that
     this module is written to transfer UCS files that might not be present,
     so a missing remote UCS won't be an error unless fail_on_missing is
     set to 'yes'.
version_added: 2.5
options:
  backup:
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can
        get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
  create_on_missing:
    description:
      - Creates the UCS based on the value of C(src) if the file does not already
        exist on the remote system.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  dest:
    description:
      - A directory to save the UCS file into.
    type: path
    required: True
  encryption_password:
    description:
      - Password to use to encrypt the UCS file if desired.
    type: str
  fail_on_missing:
    description:
      - Make the module fail if the UCS file on the remote system is missing.
    type: bool
    default: no
  force:
    description:
      - If C(no), the file will only be transferred if the destination does not
        exist.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  src:
    description:
      - The name of the UCS file to create on the remote server for downloading
    type: str
notes:
  - BIG-IP provides no way to get a checksum of the UCS files on the system
    via any interface except, perhaps, logging in directly to the box (which
    would not support appliance mode). Therefore, the best this module can
    do is check for the existence of the file on disk; no check-summing.
  - If you are using this module with either Ansible Tower or Ansible AWX, you
    should be aware of how these Ansible products execute jobs in restricted
    environments. More information can be found here
