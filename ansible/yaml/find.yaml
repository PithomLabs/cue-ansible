module: find
author: Brian Coca (@bcoca)
version_added: "2.0"
short_description: Return a list of files based on specific criteria
description:
    - Return a list of files based on specific criteria. Multiple criteria are AND'd together.
    - For Windows targets, use the M(win_find) module instead.
options:
    age:
        description:
            - Select files whose age is equal to or greater than the specified time.
            - Use a negative age to find files equal to or less than the specified time.
            - You can choose seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks by specifying the
              first letter of any of those words (e.g., "1w").
        type: str
    patterns:
        default: '*'
        description:
            - One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by C(use_regex) option.
            - The patterns restrict the list of files to be returned to those whose basenames match at
              least one of the patterns specified. Multiple patterns can be specified using a list.
            - The pattern is matched against the file base name, excluding the directory.
            - When using regexen, the pattern MUST match the ENTIRE file name, not just parts of it. So
              if you are looking to match all files ending in .default, you'd need to use '.*\.default'
              as a regexp and not just '\.default'.
            - This parameter expects a list, which can be either comma separated or YAML. If any of the
              patterns contain a comma, make sure to put them in a list to avoid splitting the patterns
              in undesirable ways.
        type: list
        aliases: [ pattern ]
    excludes:
        description:
            - One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by C(use_regex) option.
            - Items whose basenames match an C(excludes) pattern are culled from C(patterns) matches.
              Multiple patterns can be specified using a list.
        type: list
        aliases: [ exclude ]
        version_added: "2.5"
    contains:
        description:
            - A regular expression or pattern which should be matched against the file content.
        type: str
    paths:
        description:
            - List of paths of directories to search. All paths must be fully qualified.
        type: list
        required: true
        aliases: [ name, path ]
    file_type:
        description:
            - Type of file to select.
            - The 'link' and 'any' choices were added in Ansible 2.3.
        type: str
        choices: [ any, directory, file, link ]
        default: file
    recurse:
        description:
            - If target is a directory, recursively descend into the directory looking for files.
        type: bool
        default: no
    size:
        description:
            - Select files whose size is equal to or greater than the specified size.
            - Use a negative size to find files equal to or less than the specified size.
            - Unqualified values are in bytes but b, k, m, g, and t can be appended to specify
              bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes, respectively.
            - Size is not evaluated for directories.
    age_stamp:
        description:
            - Choose the file property against which we compare age.
        type: str
        choices: [ atime, ctime, mtime ]
        default: mtime
    hidden:
        description:
            - Set this to C(yes) to include hidden files, otherwise they will be ignored.
        type: bool
        default: no
    follow:
        description:
            - Set this to C(yes) to follow symlinks in path for systems with python 2.6+.
        type: bool
        default: no
    get_checksum:
        description:
            - Set this to C(yes) to retrieve a file's SHA1 checksum.
        type: bool
        default: no
    use_regex:
        description:
            - If C(no), the patterns are file globs (shell).
            - If C(yes), they are python regexes.
        type: bool
        default: no
    depth:
        description:
            - Set the maximum number of levels to descend into.
            - Setting recurse to C(no) will override this value, which is effectively depth 1.
            - Default is unlimited depth.
