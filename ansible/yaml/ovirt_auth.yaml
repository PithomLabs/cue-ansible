module: ovirt_auth
short_description: "Module to manage authentication to oVirt/RHV"
author: "Ondra Machacek (@machacekondra)"
version_added: "2.2"
description:
    - "This module authenticates to oVirt/RHV engine and creates SSO token, which should be later used in
       all other oVirt/RHV modules, so all modules don't need to perform login and logout.
       This module returns an Ansible fact called I(ovirt_auth). Every module can use this
       fact as C(auth) parameter, to perform authentication."

requirements:
  - python >= 2.7
  - ovirt-engine-sdk-python >= 4.3.0
notes:
  - "Everytime you use ovirt_auth module to obtain ticket, you need to also revoke the ticket,
     when you no longer need it, otherwise the ticket would be revoked by engine when it expires.
     For an example of how to achieve that, please take a look at I(examples) section."
  - "In order to use this module you have to install oVirt/RHV Python SDK.
     To ensure it's installed with correct version you can create the following task:
     I(pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python version=4.3.0)"
  - "Note that in oVirt/RHV 4.1 if you want to use a user which is not administrator
     you must enable the I(ENGINE_API_FILTER_BY_DEFAULT) variable in engine. In
     oVirt/RHV 4.2 and later it's enabled by default."
