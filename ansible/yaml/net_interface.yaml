short_description: Manage Interface on network devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of Interfaces
    on network devices.
deprecated:
    removed_in: "2.13"
    alternative: Use platform-specific "[netos]_interfaces" module
    why: Updated modules released with more functionality
extends_documentation_fragment: network_agnostic
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the Interface.
    required: true
  description:
    description:
      - Description of Interface.
  enabled:
    description:
      - Configure interface link status.
  speed:
    description:
      - Interface link speed.
  mtu:
    description:
      - Maximum size of transmit packet.
  duplex:
    description:
      - Interface link status
    default: auto
    choices: ['full', 'half', 'auto']
  tx_rate:
    description:
      - Transmit rate in bits per second (bps).
      - This is state check parameter only.
      - Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
  rx_rate:
    description:
      - Receiver rate in bits per second (bps).
      - This is state check parameter only.
      - Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
  delay:
    description:
      - Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote
        device. This wait is applicable for operational state argument which are
        I(state) with values C(up)/C(down), I(tx_rate) and I(rx_rate).
    default: 10
  aggregate:
    description: List of Interfaces definitions.
  purge:
    description:
      - Purge Interfaces not defined in the aggregate parameter.
        This applies only for logical interface.
    default: no
  state:
    description:
      - State of the Interface configuration, C(up) indicates present and
        operationally up and C(down) indicates present and operationally C(down)
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent', 'up', 'down']
