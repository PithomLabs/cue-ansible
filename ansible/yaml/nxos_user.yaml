short_description: Manage the collection of local users on Nexus devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of the local usernames
    configured on Cisco Nexus devices.  It allows playbooks to manage
    either individual usernames or the collection of usernames in the
    current running config.  It also supports purging usernames from the
    configuration that are not explicitly defined.
options:
  aggregate:
    description:
      - The set of username objects to be configured on the remote
        Cisco Nexus device.  The list entries can either be the username
        or a hash of username and properties.  This argument is mutually
        exclusive with the C(name) argument.
    aliases: ['users', 'collection']
    version_added: "2.4"
  name:
    description:
      - The username to be configured on the remote Cisco Nexus
        device.  This argument accepts a string value and is mutually
        exclusive with the C(aggregate) argument.
  configured_password:
    description:
      - The password to be configured on the network device. The
        password needs to be provided in cleartext and it will be encrypted
        on the device.
        Please note that this option is not same as C(provider password).
    version_added: "2.4"
  update_password:
    description:
      - Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this
        argument will instruct the module when to change the password.  When
        set to C(always), the password will always be updated in the device
        and when set to C(on_create) the password will be updated only if
        the username is created.
    default: always
    choices: ['on_create', 'always']
  role:
    description:
      - The C(role) argument configures the role for the username in the
        device running configuration.  The argument accepts a string value
        defining the role name.  This argument does not check if the role
        has been configured on the device.
    aliases: ['roles']
  sshkey:
    description:
      - The C(sshkey) argument defines the SSH public key to configure
        for the username.  This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
  purge:
    description:
      - The C(purge) argument instructs the module to consider the
        resource definition absolute.  It will remove any previously
        configured usernames on the device with the exception of the
        `admin` user which cannot be deleted per nxos constraints.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  state:
    description:
      - The C(state) argument configures the state of the username definition
        as it relates to the device operational configuration.  When set
        to I(present), the username(s) should be configured in the device active
        configuration and when set to I(absent) the username(s) should not be
        in the device active configuration
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
