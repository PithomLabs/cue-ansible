description:
    - Create, update or delete a network interface.
    - When creating a network interface you must provide the name of an existing virtual network, the name of an existing subnet within the virtual network.
    - A default security group and public IP address will be created automatically.
    - Or you can provide the name of an existing security group and public IP address.
    - See the examples below for more details.
