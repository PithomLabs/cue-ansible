module: cloudscale_floating_ip
short_description: Manages floating IPs on the cloudscale.ch IaaS service
description:
  - Create, assign and delete floating IPs on the cloudscale.ch IaaS service.
notes:
  - To create a new floating IP at least the C(ip_version) and C(server) options are required.
  - Once a floating_ip is created all parameters except C(server) are read-only.
  - It's not possible to request a floating IP without associating it with a server at the same time.
  - This module requires the ipaddress python library. This library is included in Python since version 3.3. It is available as a
    module on PyPI for earlier versions.
