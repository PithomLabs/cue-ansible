module: openssl_dhparam
version_added: "2.5"
short_description: Generate OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Parameters
description:
    - This module allows one to (re)generate OpenSSL DH-params.
    - This module uses file common arguments to specify generated file permissions.
    - "Please note that the module regenerates existing DH params if they don't
      match the module's options. If you are concerned that this could overwrite
      your existing DH params, consider using the I(backup) option."
    - The module can use the cryptography Python library, or the C(openssl) executable.
      By default, it tries to detect which one is available. This can be overridden
      with the I(select_crypto_backend) option.
requirements:
    - Either cryptography >= 2.0
    - Or OpenSSL binary C(openssl)

options:
    state:
        description:
            - Whether the parameters should exist or not,
              taking action if the state is different from what is stated.
        type: str
        default: present
        choices: [ absent, present ]
    size:
        description:
            - Size (in bits) of the generated DH-params.
        type: int
        default: 4096
    force:
        description:
            - Should the parameters be regenerated even it it already exists.
        type: bool
        default: no
    path:
        description:
            - Name of the file in which the generated parameters will be saved.
        type: path
        required: true
    backup:
        description:
            - Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original
              DH params back if you overwrote them with new ones by accident.
        type: bool
        default: no
        version_added: "2.8"
    select_crypto_backend:
        description:
            - Determines which crypto backend to use.
            - The default choice is C(auto), which tries to use C(cryptography) if available, and falls back to C(openssl).
            - If set to C(openssl), will try to use the OpenSSL C(openssl) executable.
            - If set to C(cryptography), will try to use the L(cryptography,https://cryptography.io/) library.
        type: str
        default: auto
        choices: [ auto, cryptography, openssl ]
