module: fortios_system_virtual_wan_link
short_description: Configure redundant internet connections using SD-WAN (formerly virtual WAN link) in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify system feature and virtual_wan_link category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.5
version_added: "2.8"
