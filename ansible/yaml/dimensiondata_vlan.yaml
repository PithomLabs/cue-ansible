options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the target VLAN.
      - Required if C(state) is C(present).
  description:
    description:
      - A description of the VLAN.
  network_domain:
    description:

    required: true
  private_ipv4_base_address:
    description:
        - The base address for the VLAN's IPv4 network (e.g. 192.168.1.0).
  private_ipv4_prefix_size:
    description:
        - The size of the IPv4 address space, e.g 24.
        - Required, if C(private_ipv4_base_address) is specified.
  state:
    description:
      - The desired state for the target VLAN.
      - C(readonly) ensures that the state is only ever read, not modified (the module will fail if the resource does not exist).
    choices: [present, absent, readonly]
    default: present
  allow_expand:
    description:
      - Permit expansion of the target VLAN's network if the module parameters specify a larger network than the VLAN currently possesses.
      - If C(False), the module will fail under these conditions.
      - This is intended to prevent accidental expansion of a VLAN's network (since this operation is not reversible).
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
