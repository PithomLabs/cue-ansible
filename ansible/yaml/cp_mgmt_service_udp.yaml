    description:

    type: bool
  match_by_protocol_signature:
    description:
      - A value of true enables matching by the selected protocol's signature - the signature identifies the protocol as genuine. Select this option
        to limit the port to the specified protocol. If the selected protocol does not support matching by signature, this field cannot be set to true.
    type: bool
  match_for_any:
    description:
      - Indicates whether this service is used when 'Any' is set as the rule's service and there are several service objects with the same source port
        and protocol.
    type: bool
  override_default_settings:
    description:
      - Indicates whether this service is a Data Domain service which has been overridden.
    type: bool
  port:

  protocol:
    description:
      - Select the protocol type associated with the service, and by implication, the management server (if any) that enforces Content Security and
        Authentication for the service. Selecting a Protocol Type invokes the specific protocol handlers for each protocol type, thus enabling higher level of
        security by parsing the protocol, and higher level of connectivity by tracking dynamic actions (such as opening of ports).
