  package:
    description:
      - The LX package that you want to upload or remove. When C(state) is C(present),
        and you intend to use this module in a C(role), it is recommended that you use
        the C({{ role_path }}) variable. An example is provided in the C(EXAMPLES) section.
      - When C(state) is C(absent), it is not necessary for the package to exist on the
        Ansible controller. If the full path to the package is provided, the filename will
        specifically be cherry picked from it to properly remove the package.

    type: str
    default: present
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
notes:
  - Requires the rpm tool be installed on the host. This can be accomplished through
    different ways on each platform. On Debian based systems with C(apt);
    C(apt-get install rpm). On Mac with C(brew); C(brew install rpm).
    This command is already present on RedHat based systems.
  - Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.0 because the required functionality is missing
    on versions earlier than that.
  - The module name C(bigip_iapplx_package) has been deprecated in favor of C(bigip_lx_package).
requirements:
  - Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.0
  - The 'rpm' tool installed on the Ansible controller
