module: postgresql_sequence
short_description: Create, drop, or alter a PostgreSQL sequence
description:
- Allows to create, drop or change the definition of a sequence generator.
version_added: '2.9'
options:
  sequence:
    description:
    - The name of the sequence.
    required: true
    type: str
    aliases:
    - name
  state:
    description:
    - The sequence state.
    - If I(state=absent) other options will be ignored except of I(name) and
      I(schema).
    default: present
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    type: str
  data_type:
    description:
    - Specifies the data type of the sequence. Valid types are bigint, integer,
      and smallint. bigint is the default. The data type determines the default
      minimum and maximum values of the sequence. For more info see the
      documentation
      U(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsequence.html).
    - Supported from PostgreSQL 10.
    choices: [ bigint, integer, smallint ]
    type: str
  increment:
    description:
    - Increment specifies which value is added to the current sequence value
      to create a new value.
    - A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a negative one a
      descending sequence. The default value is 1.
    type: int
  minvalue:
    description:
    - Minvalue determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. The
      default for an ascending sequence is 1. The default for a descending
      sequence is the minimum value of the data type.
    type: int
    aliases:
      - min
  maxvalue:
    description:
    - Maxvalue determines the maximum value for the sequence. The default for
      an ascending sequence is the maximum
      value of the data type. The default for a descending sequence is -1.
    type: int
    aliases:
      - max
  start:
    description:
    - Start allows the sequence to begin anywhere. The default starting value
      is I(minvalue) for ascending sequences and I(maxvalue) for descending
      ones.
    type: int
  cache:
    description:
    - Cache specifies how many sequence numbers are to be preallocated and
      stored in memory for faster access. The minimum value is 1 (only one
      value can be generated at a time, i.e., no cache), and this is also
      the default.
    type: int
  cycle:
    description:
    - The cycle option allows the sequence to wrap around when the I(maxvalue)
      or I(minvalue) has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence
      respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated will be
      the minvalue or maxvalue, respectively.
    - If C(false) (NO CYCLE) is specified, any calls to nextval after the sequence
      has reached its maximum value will return an error. False (NO CYCLE) is
      the default.
    type: bool
    default: no
  cascade:
    description:
    - Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence, and in turn all
      objects that depend on those objects.
    - Ignored if I(state=present).
    - Only used with I(state=absent).
    type: bool
    default: no
  rename_to:
    description:
    - The new name for the I(sequence).
    - Works only for existing sequences.
    type: str
  owner:
    description:
    - Set the owner for the I(sequence).
    type: str
  schema:
    description:
    - The schema of the I(sequence). This is be used to create and relocate
      a I(sequence) in the given schema.
    default: public
    type: str
  newschema:
    description:
    - The new schema for the I(sequence). Will be used for moving a
      I(sequence) to another I(schema).
    - Works only for existing sequences.
    type: str
  session_role:
    description:
    - Switch to session_role after connecting. The specified I(session_role)
      must be a role that the current I(login_user) is a member of.
    - Permissions checking for SQL commands is carried out as though
      the I(session_role) were the one that had logged in originally.
    type: str
  db:
    description:
    - Name of database to connect to and run queries against.
    type: str
    aliases:
    - database
    - login_db
notes:
- If you do not pass db parameter, sequence will be created in the database
  named postgres.
