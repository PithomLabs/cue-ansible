module: win_find
version_added: "2.3"
short_description: Return a list of files based on specific criteria
description:
    - Return a list of files based on specified criteria.
    - Multiple criteria are AND'd together.
    - For non-Windows targets, use the M(find) module instead.
options:
    age:
        description:
            - Select files or folders whose age is equal to or greater than
              the specified time.
            - Use a negative age to find files equal to or less than
              the specified time.
            - You can choose seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks
              by specifying the first letter of an of
              those words (e.g., "2s", "10d", 1w").
        type: str
    age_stamp:
        description:
            - Choose the file property against which we compare C(age).
            - The default attribute we compare with is the last modification time.
        type: str
        choices: [ atime, ctime, mtime ]
        default: mtime
    checksum_algorithm:
        description:
            - Algorithm to determine the checksum of a file.
            - Will throw an error if the host is unable to use specified algorithm.
        type: str
        choices: [ md5, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512 ]
        default: sha1
    file_type:
        description: Type of file to search for.
        type: str
        choices: [ directory, file ]
        default: file
    follow:
        description:
            - Set this to C(yes) to follow symlinks in the path.
            - This needs to be used in conjunction with C(recurse).
        type: bool
        default: no
    get_checksum:
        description:
            - Whether to return a checksum of the file in the return info (default sha1),
              use C(checksum_algorithm) to change from the default.
        type: bool
        default: yes
    hidden:
        description: Set this to include hidden files or folders.
        type: bool
        default: no
    paths:
        description:
            - List of paths of directories to search for files or folders in.
            - This can be supplied as a single path or a list of paths.
        type: list
        required: yes
    patterns:
        description:
            - One or more (powershell or regex) patterns to compare filenames with.
            - The type of pattern matching is controlled by C(use_regex) option.
            - The patterns restrict the list of files or folders to be returned based on the filenames.
            - For a file to be matched it only has to match with one pattern in a list provided.
        type: list
        aliases: [ "regex", "regexp" ]
    recurse:
        description:
            - Will recursively descend into the directory looking for files or folders.
        type: bool
        default: no
    size:
        description:
            - Select files or folders whose size is equal to or greater than the specified size.
            - Use a negative value to find files equal to or less than the specified size.
            - You can specify the size with a suffix of the byte type i.e. kilo = k, mega = m...
            - Size is not evaluated for symbolic links.
        type: str
    use_regex:
        description:
            - Will set patterns to run as a regex check if set to C(yes).
        type: bool
        default: no
