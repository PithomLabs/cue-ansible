module: win_stat
version_added: "1.7"
short_description: Get information about Windows files
description:
     - Returns information about a Windows file.
     - For non-Windows targets, use the M(stat) module instead.
options:
    path:
        description:
            - The full path of the file/object to get the facts of; both forward and
              back slashes are accepted.
        type: path
        required: yes
        aliases: [ dest, name ]
    get_md5:
        description:
            - Whether to return the checksum sum of the file. Between Ansible 1.9
              and Ansible 2.2 this is no longer an MD5, but a SHA1 instead. As of Ansible
              2.3 this is back to an MD5. Will return None if host is unable to
              use specified algorithm.
            - The default of this option changed from C(yes) to C(no) in Ansible 2.5
              and will be removed altogether in Ansible 2.9.
            - Use C(get_checksum=yes) with C(checksum_algorithm=md5) to return an
              md5 hash under the C(checksum) return value.
        type: bool
        default: no
    get_checksum:
        description:
            - Whether to return a checksum of the file (default sha1)
        type: bool
        default: yes
        version_added: "2.1"
    checksum_algorithm:
        description:
            - Algorithm to determine checksum of file.
            - Will throw an error if the host is unable to use specified algorithm.
        type: str
        default: sha1
        choices: [ md5, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512 ]
        version_added: "2.3"
    follow:
        description:
            - Whether to follow symlinks or junction points.
            - In the case of C(path) pointing to another link, then that will
              be followed until no more links are found.
        type: bool
        default: no
        version_added: "2.8"
