version_added: "2.1"
short_description: Change ACL inheritance
description:
    - Change ACL (Access Control List) inheritance and optionally copy inherited ACE's (Access Control Entry) to dedicated ACE's or vice versa.
options:
  path:
    description:
      - Path to be used for changing inheritance
    required: yes
    type: path
  state:
    description:
      - Specify whether to enable I(present) or disable I(absent) ACL inheritance.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: absent
  reorganize:
    description:
      - For P(state) = I(absent), indicates if the inherited ACE's should be copied from the parent directory.
        This is necessary (in combination with removal) for a simple ACL instead of using multiple ACE deny entries.
      - For P(state) = I(present), indicates if the inherited ACE's should be deduplicated compared to the parent directory.
        This removes complexity of the ACL structure.
    type: bool
    default: no
