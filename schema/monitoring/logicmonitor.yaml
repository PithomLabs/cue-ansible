notes:
  - You must have an existing LogicMonitor account for this module to function.
requirements: ["An existing LogicMonitor account", "Linux"]
options:
  target:
    description:
      - The type of LogicMonitor object you wish to manage.
      - "Collector: Perform actions on a LogicMonitor collector."
      - NOTE You should use Ansible service modules such as M(service) or M(supervisorctl) for managing the Collector 'logicmonitor-agent' and
        'logicmonitor-watchdog' services. Specifically, you'll probably want to start these services after a Collector add and stop these services
        before a Collector remove.
      - "Host: Perform actions on a host device."
      - "Hostgroup: Perform actions on a LogicMonitor host group."
      - >
        NOTE Host and Hostgroup tasks should always be performed via delegate_to: localhost. There are no benefits to running these tasks on the
        remote host and doing so will typically cause problems.
