module: ini_file
short_description: Tweak settings in INI files
extends_documentation_fragment: files
description:
     - Manage (add, remove, change) individual settings in an INI-style file without having
       to manage the file as a whole with, say, M(template) or M(assemble).
     - Adds missing sections if they don't exist.
     - Before Ansible 2.0, comments are discarded when the source file is read, and therefore will not show up in the destination file.
     - Since Ansible 2.3, this module adds missing ending newlines to files to keep in line with the POSIX standard, even when
       no other modifications need to be applied.
version_added: "0.9"
options:
  path:
    description:
      - Path to the INI-style file; this file is created if required.
      - Before Ansible 2.3 this option was only usable as I(dest).
    type: path
    required: true
    aliases: [ dest ]
  section:
    description:
      - Section name in INI file. This is added if C(state=present) automatically when
        a single value is being set.
      - If left empty or set to C(null), the I(option) will be placed before the first I(section).
      - Using C(null) is also required if the config format does not support sections.
    type: str
    required: true
  option:
    description:
      - If set (required for changing a I(value)), this is the name of the option.
      - May be omitted if adding/removing a whole I(section).
    type: str
  value:
    description:
      - The string value to be associated with an I(option).
      - May be omitted when removing an I(option).
    type: str
  backup:
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get
        the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
  state:
    description:
      - If set to C(absent) the option or section will be removed if present instead of created.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: present
  no_extra_spaces:
    description:
      - Do not insert spaces before and after '=' symbol.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: "2.1"
  create:
    description:
      - If set to C(no), the module will fail if the file does not already exist.
      - By default it will create the file if it is missing.
    type: bool
    default: yes
    version_added: "2.2"
  allow_no_value:
    description:
      - Allow option without value and without '=' symbol.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: "2.6"
notes:
   - While it is possible to add an I(option) without specifying a I(value), this makes no sense.
   - As of Ansible 2.3, the I(dest) option has been changed to I(path) as default, but I(dest) still works as well.
