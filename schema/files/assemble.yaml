module: assemble
short_description: Assemble configuration files from fragments
description:
- Assembles a configuration file from fragments.
- Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a
  C(conf.d) style structure where it is easy to build up the configuration
  from multiple sources. C(assemble) will take a directory of files that can be
  local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them
  together to produce a destination file.
- Files are assembled in string sorting order.
- Puppet calls this idea I(fragments).
version_added: '0.5'
options:
  src:
    description:
    - An already existing directory full of source files.
    type: path
    required: true
  dest:
    description:
    - A file to create using the concatenation of all of the source files.
    type: path
    required: true
  backup:
    description:
    - Create a backup file (if C(yes)), including the timestamp information so
      you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
      incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
  delimiter:
    description:
    - A delimiter to separate the file contents.
    type: str
    version_added: '1.4'
  remote_src:
    description:
    - If C(no), it will search for src at originating/master machine.
    - If C(yes), it will go to the remote/target machine for the src.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '1.4'
  regexp:
    description:
    - Assemble files only if C(regex) matches the filename.
    - If not set, all files are assembled.
    - Every "\" (backslash) must be escaped as "\\" to comply to YAML syntax.
    - Uses L(Python regular expressions,http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html).
    type: str
  ignore_hidden:
    description:
    - A boolean that controls if files that start with a '.' will be included or not.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '2.0'
  validate:
    description:
    - The validation command to run before copying into place.
    - The path to the file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the sshd example below.
    - The command is passed securely so shell features like expansion and pipes won't work.
