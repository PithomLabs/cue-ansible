module: iso_extract
short_description: Extract files from an ISO image
description:
- This module has two possible ways of operation.
- If 7zip is installed on the system, this module extracts files from an ISO
  into a temporary directory and copies files to a given destination,
  if needed.
- If the user has mount-capabilities (CAP_SYS_ADMIN on Linux) this module
  mounts the ISO image to a temporary location, and copies files to a given
  destination, if needed.
version_added: '2.3'
requirements:
- Either 7z (from I(7zip) or I(p7zip) package)
- Or mount capabilities (root-access, or CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability on Linux)
options:
  image:
    description:
    - The ISO image to extract files from.
    type: path
    required: yes
    aliases: [ path, src ]
  dest:
    description:
    - The destination directory to extract files to.
    type: path
    required: yes
  files:
    description:
    - A list of files to extract from the image.
    - Extracting directories does not work.
    type: list
    required: yes
  force:
    description:
    - If C(yes), which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.
    - If C(no), the file will only be extracted and copied if the destination does not already exist.
    - Alias C(thirsty) has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.13.
    type: bool
    default: yes
    aliases: [ thirsty ]
    version_added: '2.4'
  executable:
    description:
    - The path to the C(7z) executable to use for extracting files from the ISO.
    type: path
    default: '7z'
    version_added: '2.4'
notes:
- Only the file checksum (content) is taken into account when extracting files
  from the ISO image. If C(force=no), only checks the presence of the file.
- In Ansible 2.3 this module was using C(mount) and C(umount) commands only,
  requiring root access. This is no longer needed with the introduction of 7zip
  for extraction.
