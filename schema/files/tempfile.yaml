module: tempfile
version_added: "2.3"
short_description: Creates temporary files and directories
description:
  - The C(tempfile) module creates temporary files and directories. C(mktemp) command takes different parameters on various systems, this module helps
    to avoid troubles related to that. Files/directories created by module are accessible only by creator. In case you need to make them world-accessible
    you need to use M(file) module.
  - For Windows targets, use the M(win_tempfile) module instead.
