short_description: A wrapper around rsync to make common tasks in your playbooks quick and easy
description:
    - C(synchronize) is a wrapper around rsync to make common tasks in your playbooks quick and easy.
    - It is run and originates on the local host where Ansible is being run.
    - Of course, you could just use the C(command) action to call rsync yourself, but you also have to add a fair number of
      boilerplate options and host facts.
    - This module is not intended to provide access to the full power of rsync, but does make the most common
      invocations easier to implement. You `still` may need to call rsync directly via C(command) or C(shell) depending on your use case.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Path on the source host that will be synchronized to the destination.
      - The path can be absolute or relative.
    type: str
    required: true
  dest:
    description:
      - Path on the destination host that will be synchronized from the source.
      - The path can be absolute or relative.
    type: str
    required: true
  dest_port:
    description:
      - Port number for ssh on the destination host.
      - Prior to Ansible 2.0, the ansible_ssh_port inventory var took precedence over this value.
      - This parameter defaults to the value of C(ansible_ssh_port) or C(ansible_port),
        the C(remote_port) config setting or the value from ssh client configuration
        if none of the former have been set.
    type: int
    version_added: "1.5"
  mode:
    description:
      - Specify the direction of the synchronization.
      - In push mode the localhost or delegate is the source.
      - In pull mode the remote host in context is the source.
    type: str
    choices: [ pull, push ]
    default: push
  archive:
    description:
      - Mirrors the rsync archive flag, enables recursive, links, perms, times, owner, group flags and -D.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  checksum:
    description:
      - Skip based on checksum, rather than mod-time & size; Note that that "archive" option is still enabled by default - the "checksum" option will
        not disable it.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: "1.6"
  compress:
    description:
      - Compress file data during the transfer.

    default: yes
    version_added: "1.7"
  existing_only:
    description:
      - Skip creating new files on receiver.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: "1.5"
  delete:
    description:
      - Delete files in C(dest) that don't exist (after transfer, not before) in the C(src) path.
      - This option requires C(recursive=yes).
      - This option ignores excluded files and behaves like the rsync opt --delete-excluded.
    type: bool
    default: no
  dirs:
    description:
      - Transfer directories without recursing.
    type: bool
    default: no

      - This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
    type: bool
  links:
    description:
      - Copy symlinks as symlinks.
      - This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
    type: bool
  copy_links:
    description:
      - Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink.
    type: bool
    default: no
  perms:
    description:
      - Preserve permissions.
      - This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
    type: bool

  rsync_path:
    description:
      - Specify the rsync command to run on the remote host. See C(--rsync-path) on the rsync man page.
      - To specify the rsync command to run on the local host, you need to set this your task var C(ansible_rsync_path).
    type: str
  rsync_timeout:
    description:
      - Specify a C(--timeout) for the rsync command in seconds.
    type: int

  set_remote_user:
    description:
      - Put user@ for the remote paths.
      - If you have a custom ssh config to define the remote user for a host
        that does not match the inventory user, you should set this parameter to C(no).

  partial:
    description:
      - Tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.

      - Add a destination to hard link against during the rsync.
    type: list
    default:
    version_added: "2.5"
notes:
   - rsync must be installed on both the local and remote host.
   - For the C(synchronize) module, the "local host" is the host `the synchronize task originates on`, and the "destination host" is the host
     `synchronize is connecting to`.
   - The "local host" can be changed to a different host by using `delegate_to`.  This enables copying between two remote hosts or entirely on one
     remote machine.
   - >
     The user and permissions for the synchronize `src` are those of the user running the Ansible task on the local host (or the remote_user for a
     delegate_to host when delegate_to is used).
   - The user and permissions for the synchronize `dest` are those of the `remote_user` on the destination host or the `become_user` if `become=yes` is active.
   - In Ansible 2.0 a bug in the synchronize module made become occur on the "local host".  This was fixed in Ansible 2.0.1.
   - Currently, synchronize is limited to elevating permissions via passwordless sudo.  This is because rsync itself is connecting to the remote machine
     and rsync doesn't give us a way to pass sudo credentials in.
   - Currently there are only a few connection types which support synchronize (ssh, paramiko, local, and docker) because a sync strategy has been
     determined for those connection types.  Note that the connection for these must not need a password as rsync itself is making the connection and
     rsync does not provide us a way to pass a password to the connection.
   - Expect that dest=~/x will be ~<remote_user>/x even if using sudo.
   - Inspect the verbose output to validate the destination user/host/path are what was expected.
   - To exclude files and directories from being synchronized, you may add C(.rsync-filter) files to the source directory.
   - rsync daemon must be up and running with correct permission when using rsync protocol in source or destination path.
   - The C(synchronize) module forces `--delay-updates` to avoid leaving a destination in a broken in-between state if the underlying rsync process
     encounters an error. Those synchronizing large numbers of files that are willing to trade safety for performance should call rsync directly.
   - link_destination is subject to the same limitations as the underlying rsync daemon. Hard links are only preserved if the relative subtrees
     of the source and destination are the same. Attempts to hardlink into a directory that is a subdirectory of the source will be prevented.
