options:
  follow:
    description:
    - Determine whether symbolic links should be followed.
    - When set to C(yes) symbolic links will be followed, if they exist.
    - When set to C(no) symbolic links will not be followed.
    - Previous to Ansible 2.4, this was hardcoded as C(yes).
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '2.4'
notes:
- You can use the M(copy) module with the C(content:) option if you prefer the template inline,
  as part of the playbook.
- For Windows you can use M(win_template) which uses '\\r\\n' as C(newline_sequence) by default.
