version_added: "1.6"
module: twilio
short_description: Sends a text message to a mobile phone through Twilio.
description:
   - Sends a text message to a phone number through the Twilio messaging API.
notes:
   - This module is non-idempotent because it sends an email through the
     external API. It is idempotent only in the case that the module fails.
   - Like the other notification modules, this one requires an external
     dependency to work. In this case, you'll need a Twilio account with
     a purchased or verified phone number to send the text message.
