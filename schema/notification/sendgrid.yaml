version_added: "2.0"
module: sendgrid
short_description: Sends an email with the SendGrid API
description:
   - "Sends an email with a SendGrid account through their API, not through
     the SMTP service."
notes:
   - "This module is non-idempotent because it sends an email through the
     external API. It is idempotent only in the case that the module fails."
   - "Like the other notification modules, this one requires an external
     dependency to work. In this case, you'll need an active SendGrid
     account."
   - "In order to use api_key, cc, bcc, attachments, from_name, html_body, headers
     you must pip install sendgrid"
