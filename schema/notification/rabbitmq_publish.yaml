requirements: [ pika ]
notes:
  - This module requires the pika python library U(https://pika.readthedocs.io/).
  - Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.
  - This plugin is tested against RabbitMQ. Other AMQP 0.9.1 protocol based servers may work but not tested/guaranteed.
