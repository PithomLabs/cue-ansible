short_description: Modify and read dconf database
description:
  - This module allows modifications and reading of dconf database. The module
    is implemented as a wrapper around dconf tool. Please see the dconf(1) man
    page for more details.
  - Since C(dconf) requires a running D-Bus session to change values, the module
    will try to detect an existing session and reuse it, or run the tool via
    C(dbus-run-session).
notes:
  - This module depends on C(psutil) Python library (version 4.0.0 and upwards),
    C(dconf), C(dbus-send), and C(dbus-run-session) binaries. Depending on
    distribution you are using, you may need to install additional packages to
    have these available.
  - Detection of existing, running D-Bus session, required to change settings
    via C(dconf), is not 100% reliable due to implementation details of D-Bus
    daemon itself. This might lead to running applications not picking-up
    changes on the fly if options are changed via Ansible and
    C(dbus-run-session).
  - Keep in mind that the C(dconf) CLI tool, which this module wraps around,
    utilises an unusual syntax for the values (GVariant). For example, if you
    wanted to provide a string value, the correct syntax would be
    C(value="'myvalue'") - with single quotes as part of the Ansible parameter
    value.
  - When using loops in combination with a value like
    :code:`"[('xkb', 'us'), ('xkb', 'se')]"`, you need to be aware of possible
    type conversions. Applying a filter :code:`"{{ item.value | string }}"`
    to the parameter variable can avoid potential conversion problems.
  - The easiest way to figure out exact syntax/value you need to provide for a
    key is by making the configuration change in application affected by the
    key, and then having a look at value set via commands C(dconf dump
    /path/to/dir/) or C(dconf read /path/to/key).

options:
  key:
    required: true
    description:
      - A dconf key to modify or read from the dconf database.
  value:
    required: false
    description:
      - Value to set for the specified dconf key. Value should be specified in
        GVariant format. Due to complexity of this format, it is best to have a
        look at existing values in the dconf database. Required for
        C(state=present).
  state:
    required: false
    default: present
    choices:
      - read
      - present
