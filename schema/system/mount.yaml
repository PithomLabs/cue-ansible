module: mount
short_description: Control active and configured mount points
description:
  - This module controls active and configured mount points in C(/etc/fstab).
author:
  - Ansible Core Team
  - Seth Vidal (@skvidal)
version_added: "0.6"
options:
  path:
    description:
      - Path to the mount point (e.g. C(/mnt/files)).
      - Before Ansible 2.3 this option was only usable as I(dest), I(destfile) and I(name).
    type: path
    required: true
    aliases: [ name ]
  src:
    description:
      - Device to be mounted on I(path).
      - Required when I(state) set to C(present) or C(mounted).
    type: path
  fstype:
    description:
      - Filesystem type.
      - Required when I(state) is C(present) or C(mounted).
    type: str
  opts:
    description:
      - Mount options (see fstab(5), or vfstab(4) on Solaris).
    type: str
  dump:
    description:
      - Dump (see fstab(5)).
      - Note that if set to C(null) and I(state) set to C(present),
        it will cease to work and duplicate entries will be made
        with subsequent runs.
      - Has no effect on Solaris systems.
    type: str
    default: 0
  passno:
    description:
      - Passno (see fstab(5)).
      - Note that if set to C(null) and I(state) set to C(present),
        it will cease to work and duplicate entries will be made
        with subsequent runs.
      - Deprecated on Solaris systems.
    type: str
    default: 0
  state:
    description:
      - If C(mounted), the device will be actively mounted and appropriately
        configured in I(fstab). If the mount point is not present, the mount
        point will be created.
      - If C(unmounted), the device will be unmounted without changing I(fstab).
      - C(present) only specifies that the device is to be configured in
        I(fstab) and does not trigger or require a mount.
      - C(absent) specifies that the device mount's entry will be removed from
        I(fstab) and will also unmount the device and remove the mount
        point.
      - C(remounted) specifies that the device will be remounted for when you
        want to force a refresh on the mount itself (added in 2.9). This will
        always return changed=true.
    type: str
    required: true
    choices: [ absent, mounted, present, unmounted, remounted ]
  fstab:
    description:
      - File to use instead of C(/etc/fstab).
      - You should not use this option unless you really know what you are doing.
      - This might be useful if you need to configure mountpoints in a chroot environment.
      - OpenBSD does not allow specifying alternate fstab files with mount so do not
        use this on OpenBSD with any state that operates on the live filesystem.
      - This parameter defaults to /etc/fstab or /etc/vfstab on Solaris.
    type: str
  boot:
    description:
      - Determines if the filesystem should be mounted on boot.
      - Only applies to Solaris systems.
    type: bool
    default: yes
    version_added: '2.2'
  backup:
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get
        the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '2.5'
notes:
  - As of Ansible 2.3, the I(name) option has been changed to I(path) as
    default, but I(name) still works as well.
