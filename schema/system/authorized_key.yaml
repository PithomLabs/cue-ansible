    description:

    type: str
    required: true
  key:
    description:
      - The SSH public key(s), as a string or (since Ansible 1.9) url (https://github.com/username.keys).
    type: str
    required: true
  path:
    description:
      - Alternate path to the authorized_keys file.
      - When unset, this value defaults to I(~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
    type: path
    version_added: "1.2"
  manage_dir:
    description:
      - Whether this module should manage the directory of the authorized key file.
      - If set to C(yes), the module will create the directory, as well as set the owner and permissions
        of an existing directory.
      - Be sure to set C(manage_dir=no) if you are using an alternate directory for authorized_keys,
        as set with C(path), since you could lock yourself out of SSH access.
      - See the example below.
    type: bool
    default: yes
    version_added: "1.2"
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the given key (with the given key_options) should or should not be in the file.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: present
  key_options:
    description:
      - A string of ssh key options to be prepended to the key in the authorized_keys file.
    version_added: "1.4"
  exclusive:
    description:
      - Whether to remove all other non-specified keys from the authorized_keys file.
      - Multiple keys can be specified in a single C(key) string value by separating them by newlines.
      - This option is not loop aware, so if you use C(with_) , it will be exclusive per iteration of the loop.
      - If you want multiple keys in the file you need to pass them all to C(key) in a single batch as mentioned above.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: "1.9"
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - This only applies if using a https url as the source of the keys.
      - If set to C(no), the SSL certificates will not be validated.
      - This should only set to C(no) used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates as it avoids verifying the source site.
      - Prior to 2.1 the code worked as if this was set to C(yes).
    type: bool
    default: yes
    version_added: "2.1"
