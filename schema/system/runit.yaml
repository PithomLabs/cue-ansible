        description:
            - C(started)/C(stopped) are idempotent actions that will not run
              commands unless necessary.  C(restarted) will always bounce the
              service (sv restart) and C(killed) will always bounce the service (sv force-stop).
              C(reloaded) will send a HUP (sv reload).
              C(once) will run a normally downed sv once (sv once), not really
              an idempotent operation.
