    local:
        description:
            - Forces the use of "local" command alternatives on platforms that implement it.
            - This is useful in environments that use centralized authentication when you want to manipulate the local groups.
              (e.g. it uses C(lgroupadd) instead of C(groupadd)).
            - This requires that these commands exist on the targeted host, otherwise it will be a fatal error.
