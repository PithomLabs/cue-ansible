module: timezone
short_description: Configure timezone setting
description:
  - This module configures the timezone setting, both of the system clock and of the hardware clock. If you want to set up the NTP, use M(service) module.
  - It is recommended to restart C(crond) after changing the timezone, otherwise the jobs may run at the wrong time.
  - Several different tools are used depending on the OS/Distribution involved.
    For Linux it can use C(timedatectl) or edit C(/etc/sysconfig/clock) or C(/etc/timezone) and C(hwclock).
    On SmartOS, C(sm-set-timezone), for macOS, C(systemsetup), for BSD, C(/etc/localtime) is modified.
    On AIX, C(chtz) is used.
  - As of Ansible 2.3 support was added for SmartOS and BSDs.
  - As of Ansible 2.4 support was added for macOS.
  - As of Ansible 2.9 support was added for AIX 6.1+
  - Windows and HPUX are not supported, please let us know if you find any other OS/distro in which this fails.
version_added: "2.2"
options:
  name:
    description:

    description:
      - Whether the hardware clock is in UTC or in local timezone.
      - Default is to keep current setting.
      - Note that this option is recommended not to change and may fail
        to configure, especially on virtual environments such as AWS.
      - B(At least one of name and hwclock are required.)
      - I(Only used on Linux.)
    type: str
    aliases: [ rtc ]
    choices: [ local, UTC ]
notes:
  - On SmartOS the C(sm-set-timezone) utility (part of the smtools package) is required to set the zone timezone
  - On AIX only Olson/tz database timezones are useable (POSIX is not supported).
    - An OS reboot is also required on AIX for the new timezone setting to take effect.
