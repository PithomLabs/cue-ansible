short_description: Manage Interfaces on Extreme SLX-OS network devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of Interfaces
    on Extreme SLX-OS network devices.
notes:
  - Tested against SLX-OS 17s.1.02
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the Interface.
    required: true
  description:
    description:
      - Description of Interface.
  enabled:
    description:
      - Interface link status.
    default: True
    type: bool
  speed:
    description:
      - Interface link speed.
  mtu:
    description:
      - Maximum size of transmit packet.
  tx_rate:
    description:
      - Transmit rate in bits per second (bps).
  rx_rate:
    description:
      - Receiver rate in bits per second (bps).
  neighbors:
    description:
      - Check the operational state of given interface C(name) for LLDP neighbor.
      - The following suboptions are available.
    suboptions:
        host:
          description:
            - "LLDP neighbor host for given interface C(name)."
        port:
          description:
            - "LLDP neighbor port to which given interface C(name) is connected."
  aggregate:
    description: List of Interfaces definitions.
  delay:
    description:
      - Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote
        device. This wait is applicable for operational state argument which are
        I(state) with values C(up)/C(down), I(tx_rate) and I(rx_rate).
    default: 10
  state:
    description:
      - State of the Interface configuration, C(up) means present and
        operationally up and C(down) means present and operationally C(down)
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent', 'up', 'down']
