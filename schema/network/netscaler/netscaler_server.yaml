                Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore C(_) character, and must contain only ASCII
                alphanumeric, underscore C(_), hash C(#), period C(.), space C( ), colon C(:), at C(@), equals C(=), and hyphen C(-)
                characters.

            - "Minimum length = 1"

    ipaddress:
        description:
            - >-
                IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server. If you create an IP address based server, you can specify the
                name of the server, instead of its IP address, when creating a service. Note: If you do not create a
                server entry, the server IP address that you enter when you create a service becomes the name of the
                server.

    domain:
        description:
            - "Domain name of the server. For a domain based configuration, you must create the server first."
            - "Minimum length = 1"

    translationip:
        description:
            - "IP address used to transform the server's DNS-resolved IP address."

    translationmask:
        description:
            - "The netmask of the translation ip."

    domainresolveretry:
        description:
            - >-
                Time, in seconds, for which the NetScaler appliance must wait, after DNS resolution fails, before
                sending the next DNS query to resolve the domain name.
            - "Minimum value = C(5)"
            - "Maximum value = C(20939)"
        default: 5

    ipv6address:
        description:
            - >-
                Support IPv6 addressing mode. If you configure a server with the IPv6 addressing mode, you cannot use
                the server in the IPv4 addressing mode.
        default: false
        type: bool

    td:
        description:
            - >-
                Integer value that uniquely identifies the traffic domain in which you want to configure the entity.
                If you do not specify an ID, the entity becomes part of the default traffic domain, which has an ID
                of 0.

            - "Maximum value = C(4094)"

    graceful:
        description:
            - >-
                Shut down gracefully, without accepting any new connections, and disabling each service when all of
                its connections are closed.
            - This option is meaningful only when setting the I(disabled) option to C(true)
        type: bool
        version_added: "2.5"

    delay:
        description:
            - Time, in seconds, after which all the services configured on the server are disabled.
            - This option is meaningful only when setting the I(disabled) option to C(true)
        version_added: "2.5"

    disabled:
        description:
            - When set to C(true) the server state will be set to C(disabled).
            - When set to C(false) the server state will be set to C(enabled).
            - >-
                Note that due to limitations of the underlying NITRO API a C(disabled) state change alone
                does not cause the module result to report a changed status.
        type: bool
