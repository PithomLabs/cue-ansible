short_description: Fetch configuration/state data from NETCONF enabled network devices.
description:
    - NETCONF is a network management protocol developed and standardized by
      the IETF. It is documented in RFC 6241.
    - This module allows the user to fetch configuration and state data from NETCONF
      enabled network devices.
extends_documentation_fragment: network_agnostic
options:
  source:
    description:
      - This argument specifies the datastore from which configuration data should be fetched.
        Valid values are I(running), I(candidate) and I(startup). If the C(source) value is not
        set both configuration and state information are returned in response from running datastore.
    choices: ['running', 'candidate', 'startup']
  filter:
    description:
      - This argument specifies the XML string which acts as a filter to restrict the portions of
        the data to be are retrieved from the remote device. If this option is not specified entire
        configuration or state data is returned in result depending on the value of C(source)
        option. The C(filter) value can be either XML string or XPath, if the filter is in
        XPath format the NETCONF server running on remote host should support xpath capability
        else it will result in an error.
  display:
    description:
      - Encoding scheme to use when serializing output from the device. The option I(json) will
        serialize the output as JSON data. If the option value is I(json) it requires jxmlease
        to be installed on control node. The option I(pretty) is similar to received XML response
        but is using human readable format (spaces, new lines). The option value I(xml) is similar
        to received XML response but removes all XML namespaces.
    choices: ['json', 'pretty', 'xml']
  lock:
    description:
      - Instructs the module to explicitly lock the datastore specified as C(source). If no
        I(source) is defined, the I(running) datastore will be locked. By setting the option
        value I(always) is will explicitly lock the datastore mentioned in C(source) option.
        By setting the option value I(never) it will not lock the C(source) datastore. The
        value I(if-supported) allows better interworking with NETCONF servers, which do not
        support the (un)lock operation for all supported datastores.
    default: never
    choices: ['never', 'always', 'if-supported']
requirements:
  - ncclient (>=v0.5.2)
  - jxmlease

notes:
  - This module requires the NETCONF system service be enabled on
    the remote device being managed.
  - This module supports the use of connection=netconf
