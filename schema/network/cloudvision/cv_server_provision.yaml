short_description:
    Provision server port by applying or removing template configuration to an
    Arista CloudVision Portal configlet that is applied to a switch.
description:
  - This module allows a server team to provision server network ports for
    new servers without having to access Arista CVP or asking the network team
    to do it for them. Provide the information for connecting to CVP, switch
    rack, port the new server is connected to, optional vlan, and an action
    and the module will apply the configuration to the switch port via CVP.
    Actions are add (applies template config to port),
    remove (defaults the interface config) and
    show (returns the current port config).
options:
  host:
    description:
      - The hostname or IP address of the CVP node being connected to.
    required: true
  port:
    description:
      - The port number to use when making API calls to the CVP node. This
        will default to the default port for the specified protocol. Port 80
        for http and port 443 for https.
  protocol:
    description:
      - The protocol to use when making API calls to CVP. CVP defaults to https
        and newer versions of CVP no longer support http.
    default: https
    choices: [https, http]
  username:
    description:
      - The user that will be used to connect to CVP for making API calls.
    required: true
  password:
    description:
      - The password of the user that will be used to connect to CVP for API
        calls.
    required: true
  server_name:
    description:
      - The hostname or identifier for the server that is having it's switch
        port provisioned.
    required: true
  switch_name:
    description:
      - The hostname of the switch is being configured for the server being
        provisioned.
    required: true
  switch_port:
    description:
      - The physical port number on the switch that the new server is
        connected to.
    required: true
  port_vlan:
    description:
      - The vlan that should be applied to the port for this server.
        This parameter is dependent on a proper template that supports single
        vlan provisioning with it. If a port vlan is specified by the template
        specified does not support this the module will exit out with no
        changes. If a template is specified that requires a port vlan but no
        port vlan is specified the module will exit out with no changes.
  template:
    description:
      - A path to a Jinja formatted template file that contains the
        configuration block that will be applied to the specified switch port.
        This template will have variable fields replaced by the module before
        being applied to the switch configuration.
    required: true
  action:
    description:
      - The action for the module to take. The actions are add, which applies
        the specified template config to port, remove, which defaults the
        specified interface configuration, and show, which will return the
        current port configuration with no changes.
    default: show
    choices: [show, add, remove]
  auto_run:
    description:
      - Flag that determines whether or not the module will execute the CVP
        task spawned as a result of changes to a switch configlet. When an
        add or remove action is taken which results in a change to a switch
        configlet, CVP will spawn a task that needs to be executed for the
        configuration to be applied to the switch. If this option is True then
        the module will determined the task number created by the configuration
        change, execute it and wait for the task to complete. If the option
        is False then the task will remain in the Pending state in CVP for
        a network administrator to review and execute.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
requirements: [Jinja2, cvprac >= 0.7.0]
