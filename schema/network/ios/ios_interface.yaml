short_description: Manage Interface on Cisco IOS network devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of Interfaces
    on Cisco IOS network devices.
deprecated:
  removed_in: '2.13'
  alternative: ios_interfaces
  why: Newer and updated modules released with more functionality in Ansible 2.9
notes:
  - Tested against IOS 15.6

    description:
      - Interface link status.
    type: bool
  speed:
    description:
      - Interface link speed.
  mtu:
    description:
      - Maximum size of transmit packet.
  duplex:
    description:
      - Interface link status
    default: auto
    choices: ['full', 'half', 'auto']
  tx_rate:
    description:
      - Transmit rate in bits per second (bps).
      - This is state check parameter only.
      - Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)

  neighbors:
    description:
      - Check the operational state of given interface C(name) for CDP/LLDP neighbor.
      - The following suboptions are available.
    suboptions:
        host:
          description:
            - "CDP/LLDP neighbor host for given interface C(name)."
        port:
          description:
            - "CDP/LLDP neighbor port to which given interface C(name) is connected."
  aggregate:
    description: List of Interfaces definitions.
  delay:
    description:
      - Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote
        device. This wait is applicable for operational state argument which are
        I(state) with values C(up)/C(down), I(tx_rate) and I(rx_rate).
    default: 10
  state:
    description:
      - State of the Interface configuration, C(up) means present and
        operationally up and C(down) means present and operationally C(down)
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent', 'up', 'down']
