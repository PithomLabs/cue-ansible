short_description: Manage the collection of VRF definitions on Cisco IOS devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of VRF definitions on
    Cisco IOS devices.  It allows playbooks to manage individual or
    the entire VRF collection.  It also supports purging VRF definitions from
    the configuration that are not explicitly defined.
extends_documentation_fragment: ios
notes:
  - Tested against IOS 15.6
options:
  vrfs:
    description:
      - The set of VRF definition objects to be configured on the remote
        IOS device.  Ths list entries can either be the VRF name or a hash
        of VRF definitions and attributes.  This argument is mutually
        exclusive with the C(name) argument.
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the VRF definition to be managed on the remote IOS
        device.  The VRF definition name is an ASCII string name used
        to uniquely identify the VRF.  This argument is mutually exclusive
        with the C(vrfs) argument
  description:
    description:
      - Provides a short description of the VRF definition in the
        current active configuration.  The VRF definition value accepts
        alphanumeric characters used to provide additional information
        about the VRF.
  rd:
    description:
      - The router-distinguisher value uniquely identifies the VRF to
        routing processes on the remote IOS system.  The RD value takes
        the form of C(A:B) where C(A) and C(B) are both numeric values.
  interfaces:
    description:
      - Identifies the set of interfaces that
        should be configured in the VRF.  Interfaces must be routed
        interfaces in order to be placed into a VRF.
  associated_interfaces:
    description:
      - This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vrf C(name)
        for associated interfaces. If the value in the C(associated_interfaces) does not match with
        the operational state of vrf interfaces on device it will result in failure.
    version_added: "2.5"
  delay:
    description:
      - Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote
        device.
    version_added: "2.4"
    default: 10
  purge:
    description:
      - Instructs the module to consider the
        VRF definition absolute.  It will remove any previously configured
        VRFs on the device.
    default: false
    type: bool
  state:
    description:
      - Configures the state of the VRF definition
        as it relates to the device operational configuration.  When set
        to I(present), the VRF should be configured in the device active
        configuration and when set to I(absent) the VRF should not be
        in the device active configuration
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
