description: This module configures and manages the Link Layer Discovery Protocol(LLDP) attributes on IOS platforms.
author: Sumit Jaiswal (@justjais)
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSv Version 15.2 on VIRL
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli),
    See L(IOS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).

      holdtime:
        description:
          - LLDP holdtime (in sec) to be sent in packets.
          - Refer to vendor documentation for valid values.
        type: int
      reinit:
        description:
          - Specify the delay (in secs) for LLDP to initialize.
          - Refer to vendor documentation for valid values.
          - NOTE, if LLDP reinit is configured with a starting
            value, idempotency won't be maintained as the Cisco
            device doesn't record the starting reinit configured
            value. As such, Ansible cannot verify if the respective
            starting reinit value is already configured or not from
            the device side. If you try to apply starting reinit
            value in every play run, Ansible will show changed as True.
            For any other reinit value, idempotency will be maintained
            since any other reinit value is recorded in the Cisco device.

      tlv_select:
        description:
          - Selection of LLDP TLVs i.e. type-length-value to send
          - NOTE, if tlv-select is configured idempotency won't be maintained
            as Cisco device doesn't record configured tlv-select options. As
            such, Ansible cannot verify if the respective tlv-select options is
            already configured or not from the device side. If you try to apply
            tlv-select option in every play run, Ansible will show changed as True.
