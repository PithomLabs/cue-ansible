short_description: Roll back the running or startup configuration from a remote
 server on devices running Lenovo CNOS
description:
    - This module allows you to work with switch configurations. It provides a
     way to roll back configurations of a switch from a remote server. This is
     achieved by using startup or running configurations of the target device
     that were previously backed up to a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP,
     or SCP. The first step is to create a directory from where the remote
     server can be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of
     he backup configuration's location. Authentication details required by the
     remote server must be provided as well.
     By default, this method overwrites the switch's configuration file with
     the newly downloaded file. This module uses SSH to manage network device
     configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory
     named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory
     to where the playbook is run.
