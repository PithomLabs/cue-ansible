    suboptions:
      host:
        description:
          - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote
            device over the specified transport.  The value of host is used as
            the destination address for the transport.
        required: true
      port:
        description:
          - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.

      username:
        description:
          - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to
            the remote device.  This value is used to authenticate
            the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the
            value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME) will be used instead.
      password:
        description:
          - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to
            the remote device.   This value is used to authenticate
            the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the
            value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD) will be used instead.
      timeout:
        description:
          - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device

            in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE)
            will be used instead.
      authorize:
        description:
          - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device
            before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device will
            attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value
            is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
            C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE) will be used instead.

        default: 'no'
      auth_pass:
        description:
          - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode
            on the remote device.  If I(authorize) is false, then this argument
            does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of
            environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS) will be used instead.
