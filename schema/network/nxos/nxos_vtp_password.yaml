notes:
    - Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
    - VTP feature must be active on the device to use this module.
    - This module is used to manage only VTP passwords.
    - Use this in combination with M(nxos_vtp_domain) and M(nxos_vtp_version)
      to fully manage VTP operations.
    - You can set/remove password only if a VTP domain already exist.
    - If C(state=absent) and no C(vtp_password) is provided, it remove the current
      VTP password.
    - If C(state=absent) and C(vtp_password) is provided, the proposed C(vtp_password)
      has to match the existing one in order to remove it.
