  - Manages HSRP configuration on NX-OS switches.

notes:
  - Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
  - HSRP feature needs to be enabled first on the system.
  - SVIs must exist before using this module.
  - Interface must be a L3 port before using this module.
  - HSRP cannot be configured on loopback interfaces.
  - MD5 authentication is only possible with HSRPv2 while it is ignored if
    HSRPv1 is used instead, while it will not raise any error. Here we allow
    MD5 authentication only with HSRPv2 in order to enforce better practice.

  auth_string:
    description:
      - Authentication string. If this needs to be hidden(for md5 type), the string
        should be 7 followed by the key string. Otherwise, it can be 0 followed by
        key string or just key string (for backward compatibility). For text type,
        this should be just be a key string. if this is 'default', authentication
        is removed.
