  - Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM tcp half-open monitors.
version_added: 2.6
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Monitor name.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the C(tcp_half_open)
        parent on the C(Common) partition.
    type: str
    default: "/Common/tcp_half_open"
  ip:
    description:
      - IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'.
    type: str
  port:
    description:
      - Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535
        must be specified
    type: str
  interval:
    description:
      - Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor
        check when either the resource is down or the status of the resource is unknown.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the
        default value will be C(30). This value B(must) be less than the C(timeout) value.
    type: int
  timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the
        monitor request.
      - If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up.
      - If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down.
      - When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the parent monitor.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then
        the default value will be C(120).
    type: int
  probe_interval:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds the big3d process waits before sending out a
        subsequent probe attempt when a probe fails and multiple probe attempts have
        been requested.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(1).
    type: int
  probe_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request
        to the system.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(5).
    type: int
  probe_attempts:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of times the system attempts to probe the host server, after
        which the system considers the host server down or unavailable.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(3).
    type: int
  ignore_down_response:
    description:
      - Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
      - When C(yes), specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of
        the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout is reached without the system receiving
        an up response, the system marks the object down.
      - When C(no), specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it
        receives a down response.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  transparent:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the monitor operates in transparent mode.
      - A monitor in transparent mode directs traffic through the associated pool members
        or nodes (usually a router or firewall) to the aliased destination (that is, it
        probes the C(ip)-C(port) combination specified in the monitor).
      - If the monitor cannot successfully reach the aliased destination, the pool member
        or node through which the monitor traffic was sent is marked down.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the monitor exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the monitor is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
notes:
  - Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
