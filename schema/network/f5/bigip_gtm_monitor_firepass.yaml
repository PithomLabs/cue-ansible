  - Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM FirePass monitors.
version_added: 2.6
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Monitor name.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the C(tcp)
        parent on the C(Common) partition.
    type: str
    default: /Common/firepass_gtm
  ip:
    description:
      - IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'.
      - If this value is an IP address, then a C(port) number must be specified.
    type: str
  port:
    description:
      - Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535
        must be specified.
    type: str
  interval:
    description:
      - The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this
        template will run.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then
        the default value will be 30.
      - This value B(must) be less than the C(timeout) value.
    type: int
  timeout:
    description:
      - The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to
        the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time
        period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within
        the set time period, it is considered down. You can change this
        number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the
        interval number of seconds plus 1 second.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then
        the default value will be 90.
    type: int
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the monitor exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the monitor is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
  probe_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request
        to the system.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(5).
    type: int
  ignore_down_response:
    description:
      - Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
      - When C(yes), specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of
        the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout is reached without the system receiving
        an up response, the system marks the object down.
      - When C(no), specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it
        receives a down response.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  target_username:
    description:
      - Specifies the user name, if the monitored target requires authentication.
    type: str
  target_password:
    description:
      - Specifies the password, if the monitored target requires authentication.
    type: str
  update_password:
    description:
      - C(always) will update passwords if the C(target_password) is specified.
      - C(on_create) will only set the password for newly created monitors.
    type: str
    choices:
      - always
      - on_create
    default: always
  cipher_list:
    description:
      - Specifies the list of ciphers for this monitor.
      - The items in the cipher list are separated with the colon C(:) symbol.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        list is C(HIGH:!ADH).
    type: str
  max_load_average:
    description:
      - Specifies the number that the monitor uses to mark the Secure Access Manager
        system up or down.
      - The system compares the Max Load Average setting against a one-minute average
        of the Secure Access Manager system load.
      - When the Secure Access Manager system-load average falls within the specified
        Max Load Average, the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up.
      - When the average exceeds the setting, the monitor marks the system down.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        is C(12).
    type: int
  concurrency_limit:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum percentage of licensed connections currently in use under
        which the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up.
      - As an example, a setting of 95 percent means that the monitor marks the Secure
        Access Manager system up until 95 percent of licensed connections are in use.
      - When the number of in-use licensed connections exceeds 95 percent, the monitor
        marks the Secure Access Manager system down.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default is C(95).
