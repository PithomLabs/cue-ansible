description:
  - Manages F5 BIG-IP LTM pools via iControl REST API.
version_added: 1.2
options:
  description:
    description:
      - Specifies descriptive text that identifies the pool.
    type: str
    version_added: 2.3
  name:
    description:
      - Pool name
    type: str
    required: True
    aliases:
      - pool
  lb_method:
    description:
      - Load balancing method. When creating a new pool, if this value is not
        specified, the default of C(round-robin) will be used.
    type: str
    version_added: 1.3
    choices:
      - dynamic-ratio-member
      - dynamic-ratio-node
      - fastest-app-response
      - fastest-node
      - least-connections-member

      - round-robin
      - weighted-least-connections-member
      - weighted-least-connections-node
  monitor_type:
    description:
      - Monitor rule type when C(monitors) is specified.
      - When creating a new pool, if this value is not specified, the default
        of 'and_list' will be used.
      - When C(single) ensures that all specified monitors are checked, but
        additionally includes checks to make sure you only specified a single
        monitor.
      - When C(and_list) ensures that B(all) monitors are checked.
      - When C(m_of_n) ensures that C(quorum) of C(monitors) are checked. C(m_of_n)
        B(requires) that a C(quorum) of 1 or greater be set either in the playbook,
        or already existing on the device.
      - Both C(single) and C(and_list) are functionally identical since BIG-IP
        considers all monitors as "a list".
    type: str
    choices:
      - and_list
      - m_of_n
      - single
    version_added: 1.3
  quorum:
    description:
      - Monitor quorum value when C(monitor_type) is C(m_of_n).
      - Quorum must be a value of 1 or greater when C(monitor_type) is C(m_of_n).
    type: int
    version_added: 1.3
  monitors:
    description:
      - Monitor template name list. If the partition is not provided as part of
        the monitor name, then the C(partition) option will be used instead.
    type: list
    version_added: 1.3
  slow_ramp_time:
    description:
      - Sets the ramp-up time (in seconds) to gradually ramp up the load on
        newly added or freshly detected up pool members.
    type: int
    version_added: 1.3
  reselect_tries:
    description:
      - Sets the number of times the system tries to contact a pool member
        after a passive failure.
    type: int
    version_added: 2.2
  service_down_action:
    description:
      - Sets the action to take when node goes down in pool.
    type: str
    choices:
      - none
      - reset
      - drop
      - reselect
    version_added: 1.3
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
    version_added: 2.5
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), guarantees that the pool exists with the provided
        attributes.
      - When C(absent), removes the pool from the system.
    type: str
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
    default: present
    version_added: 2.5
  metadata:
    description:
      - Arbitrary key/value pairs that you can attach to a pool. This is useful in
        situations where you might want to annotate a pool to me managed by Ansible.
      - Key names will be stored as strings; this includes names that are numbers.
      - Values for all of the keys will be stored as strings; this includes values
        that are numbers.
      - Data will be persisted, not ephemeral.
    type: raw
    version_added: 2.5
  priority_group_activation:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the system load balances traffic according to the priority
        number assigned to the pool member.
      - When creating a new pool, if this parameter is not specified, the default of
        C(0) will be used.
      - To disable this setting, provide the value C(0).
      - Once you enable this setting, you can specify pool member priority when you
        create a new pool or on a pool member's properties screen.
      - The system treats same-priority pool members as a group.
      - To enable priority group activation, provide a number from C(0) to C(65535)
        that represents the minimum number of members that must be available in one
        priority group before the system directs traffic to members in a lower
        priority group.
      - When a sufficient number of members become available in the higher priority
        group, the system again directs traffic to the higher priority group.
    type: int
    aliases:
      - minimum_active_members
    version_added: 2.6
  aggregate:
    description:
      - List of pool definitions to be created, modified or removed.
      - When using C(aggregates) if one of the aggregate definitions is invalid, the aggregate run will fail,
        indicating the error it last encountered.
      - The module will C(NOT) rollback any changes it has made prior to encountering the error.
      - The module also will not indicate what changes were made prior to failure, therefore it is strongly advised
        to run the module in check mode to make basic validation, prior to module execution.
    type: list
    aliases:
      - pools
    version_added: 2.8
  replace_all_with:
    description:
      - Remove pools not defined in the C(aggregate) parameter.
      - This operation is all or none, meaning that it will stop if there are some pools
        that cannot be removed.
    type: bool
    default: no
    aliases:
      - purge
    version_added: 2.8
notes:
  - To add members to a pool, use the C(bigip_pool_member) module. Previously, the
    C(bigip_pool) module allowed the management of members, but this has been removed
    in version 2.5 of Ansible.
