    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the C(dns)
        parent on the C(Common) partition.
    type: str
    default: /Common/dns
  description:
    description:
      - The description of the monitor.
    type: str
  interval:
    description:
      - The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this
        template will run.
      - This value B(must) be less than the C(timeout) value.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, the
        default C(5) will be used.
    type: int
  up_interval:
    description:
      - Specifies the interval for the system to use to perform the health check
        when a resource is up.
      - When C(0), specifies that the system uses the interval specified in
        C(interval) to check the health of the resource.
      - When any other number, enables specification of a different interval to
        use when checking the health of a resource that is up.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, the
        default C(0) will be used.
    type: int
  timeout:
    description:
      - The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to
        the monitor request.
      - If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up.
      - If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down.
      - You can change this number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the
        interval number of seconds plus 1 second.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be C(16).
    type: int
  transparent:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the monitor operates in transparent mode.
      - Monitors in transparent mode can monitor pool members through firewalls.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  reverse:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the monitor operates in reverse mode.
      - When the monitor is in reverse mode, a successful receive string match
        marks the monitored object down instead of up. You can use the
        this mode only if you configure the C(receive) option.
      - This parameter is not compatible with the C(time_until_up) parameter. If
        C(time_until_up) is specified, it must be C(0). Or, if it already exists, it
        must be C(0).
    type: bool
  receive:
    description:
      - Specifies the IP address that the monitor uses from the resource record sections
        of the DNS response.
      - The IP address should be specified in the dotted-decimal notation or IPv6 notation.
    type: str
  time_until_up:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful
        response before a node will be marked up.
      - A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked up immediately after a valid
        response is received from the node.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be C(0).
    type: int
  manual_resume:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the system automatically changes the status of a resource
        to B(enabled) at the next successful monitor check.
      - If you set this option to C(yes), you must manually re-enable the resource
        before the system can use it for load balancing connections.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        value is C(no).
      - When C(yes), specifies that you must manually re-enable the resource after an
        unsuccessful monitor check.
      - When C(no), specifies that the system automatically changes the status of a
        resource to B(enabled) at the next successful monitor check.
    type: bool
  ip:
    description:
      - IP address part of the IP/port definition.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the
        default value will be C(*).
    type: str
  port:
    description:
      - Port address part of the IP/port definition.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be C(*).
      - Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified.
    type: str
  query_name:
    description:
      - Specifies a query name for the monitor to use in a DNS query.
    type: str
  query_type:
    description:
      - Specifies the type of DNS query that the monitor sends.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        value is C(a).
      - When C(a), specifies that the monitor will send a DNS query of type A.
      - When C(aaaa), specifies that the monitor will send a DNS query of type AAAA.
    type: str
    choices:
      - a
      - aaaa
  answer_section_contains:
    description:
      - Specifies the type of DNS query that the monitor sends.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this value is not specified, the default
        value is C(query-type).
      - When C(query-type), specifies that the response should contain at least one
        answer of which the resource record type matches the query type.
      - When C(any-type), specifies that the DNS message should contain at least one answer.
      - When C(anything), specifies that an empty answer is enough to mark the status of
        the node up.
    type: str
    choices:
      - any-type
      - anything
      - query-type
  accept_rcode:
    description:
      - Specifies the RCODE required in the response for an up status.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        value is C(no-error).
      - When C(no-error), specifies that the status of the node will be marked up if
        the received DNS message has no error.
      - When C(anything), specifies that the status of the node will be marked up
        irrespective of the RCODE in the DNS message received.
      - If this parameter is set to C(anything), it will disregard the C(receive)
        string, and nullify it if the monitor is being updated.
    type: str
    choices:
      - no-error
      - anything
  adaptive:
    description:
      - Specifies whether adaptive response time monitoring is enabled for this monitor.
      - When C(yes), the monitor determines the state of a service based on how divergent
        from the mean latency a monitor probe for that service is allowed to be.
        Also, values for the C(allowed_divergence), C(adaptive_limit), and
        and C(sampling_timespan) will be enforced.
      - When C(disabled), the monitor determines the state of a service based on the
        C(interval), C(up_interval), C(time_until_up), and C(timeout) monitor settings.
    type: bool
  allowed_divergence_type:
    description:
      - When specifying a new monitor, if C(adaptive) is C(yes), the default is
        C(relative)
      - When C(absolute), the number of milliseconds the latency of a monitor probe
        can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for the service being probed.
        In typical cases, if the monitor detects three probes in a row that miss the
        latency value you set, the pool member or node is marked down.
      - When C(relative), the percentage of deviation the latency of a monitor probe
        can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for the service being probed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - relative
      - absolute
  allowed_divergence_value:
    description:
      - When specifying a new monitor, if C(adaptive) is C(yes), and C(type) is
        C(relative), the default is C(25) percent.
    type: int
  adaptive_limit:
    description:
      - Specifies the absolute number of milliseconds that may not be exceeded by a monitor
        probe, regardless of C(allowed_divergence) setting, for a probe to be
        considered successful.
      - This value applies regardless of the value of the C(allowed_divergence) setting.
      - While this value can be configured when C(adaptive) is C(no), it will not take
        effect on the system until C(adaptive) is C(yes).
    type: int
  sampling_timespan:
    description:
      - Specifies the length, in seconds, of the probe history window that the system
        uses to calculate the mean latency and standard deviation of a monitor probe.
      - While this value can be configured when C(adaptive) is C(no), it will not take
        effect on the system until C(adaptive) is C(yes).
    type: int

      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
