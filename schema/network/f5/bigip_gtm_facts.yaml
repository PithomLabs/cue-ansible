    required: True
    choices:
      - pool
      - wide_ip
      - server
  filter:
    description:
      - Perform regex filter of response. Filtering is done on the name of
        the resource. Valid filters are anything that can be provided to
        Python's C(re) module.
deprecated:
  removed_in: '2.11'
  alternative: bigip_device_info
  why: >
    The bigip_gtm_facts module is an outlier as all facts are being collected
    in the bigip_device_info module. Additionally, the M(bigip_device_info)
    module is easier to maintain and use.
