      protocol:
        description:
          - Specifies the IP protocol entry for which the timer policy rule is being

            C(sctp).
          - Only flows matching the configured protocol will make use of this rule.
          - When C(all-other) is specified, if there are no specific ip-protocol rules
            that match the flow, the flow matches all the other ip-protocol rules.
          - When specifying rules, if this parameter is not specified, the default of
            C(all-other) will be used.

            dash (-).
          - This field is only available if you have selected the C(sctp), C(tcp), or
            C(udp) protocol.
        type: list
      idle_timeout:
        description:
          - Specifies an idle timeout, in seconds, for protocol and port pairs that
            match the timer policy rule.
          - When C(infinite), specifies that the protocol and port pairs that match
            the timer policy rule have no idle timeout.
          - When specifying rules, if this parameter is not specified, the default of
