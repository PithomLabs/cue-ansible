version_added: 2.8
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the OCSP certificate validator.
    type: str
    required: True
  cache_error_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the lifetime of an error response in the cache, in seconds.
    type: int
  proxy_server_pool:
    description:
      - Specifies the proxy server pool the BIG-IP system uses to fetch the OCSP
        response.
      - This involves creating a pool with proxy-servers.
      - Use this option when either the OCSP responder cannot be reached on any of
        BIG-IP system's interfaces or one or more servers can proxy an HTTP request
        to an external server and fetch the response.
    type: str
  cache_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the lifetime of the OCSP response in the cache, in seconds.
    type: str
  clock_skew:
    description:
      - Specifies the tolerable absolute difference in the clocks of the responder
        and the BIG-IP system, in seconds.
    type: int
  connections_limit:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum number of connections per second allowed for the
        OCSP certificate validator.
    type: int
  dns_resolver:
    description:
      - Specifies the internal DNS resolver the BIG-IP system uses to fetch the
        OCSP response.
      - This involves specifying one or more DNS servers in the DNS resolver
        configuration.
      - Use this option when either there is a DNS server that can do the
        name-resolution of the OCSP responders or the OCSP responder can be
        reached on one of BIG-IP system's interfaces.
    type: str

    description:
      - Specifies a certificate used to sign an OCSP request.
    type: str
  key:
    description:
      - Specifies a key used to sign an OCSP request.
    type: str
  passphrase:
    description:
      - Specifies a passphrase used to sign an OCSP request.
    type: str
  status_age:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum allowed lag time that the BIG-IP system accepts for

  strict_responder_checking:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the responder's certificate is checked for an OCSP
        signing extension.

    description:
      - Specifies the time interval that the BIG-IP system waits for before
        ending the connection to the OCSP responder, in seconds.
    type: int
  trusted_responders:
    description:
      - Specifies the certificates used for validating the OCSP response
        when the responder's certificate has been omitted from the response.
    type: str
  responder_url:
    description:
      - Specifies the absolute URL that overrides the OCSP responder URL
        obtained from the certificate's AIA extensions. This should be an
        HTTP-based URL.
    type: str
  update_password:
    description:
