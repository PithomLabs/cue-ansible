module: bigip_asm_policy
short_description: Manage BIG-IP ASM policies
description:
   - Manage BIG-IP ASM policies.
version_added: 2.5
deprecated:
  removed_in: '2.12'
  alternative: bigip_asm_policy_manage
  why: >
    The bigip_asm_policy module has been split into three new modules to handle import, export and general policy
    management. This will allow scalability of the asm policy management as well as ease of maintenance.
    Additionally to further reduce the burden of having multiple smaller module F5 has created asm_policy
    role in Ansible Galaxy for a more declarative way of ASM policy management.
options:
  active:
    description:
      - If C(yes) will apply and activate existing inactive policy. If C(no), it will
        deactivate existing active policy. Generally should be C(yes) only in cases where
        you want to activate new or existing policy.
    default: no
    type: bool
  name:
    description:
      - The ASM policy to manage or create.
    required: True
  state:
    description:
      - When C(state) is C(present), and C(file) or C(template) parameter is provided,
        new ASM policy is imported and created with the given C(name).
      - When C(state) is present and no C(file) or C(template) parameter is provided
        new blank ASM policy is created with the given C(name).
      - When C(state) is C(absent), ensures that the policy is removed, even if it is
        currently active.
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
  file:
    description:
      - Full path to a policy file to be imported into the BIG-IP ASM.
      - Policy files exported from newer versions of BIG-IP cannot be imported into older
        versions of BIG-IP. The opposite, however, is true; you can import older into
        newer.
  template:
    description:
      - An ASM policy built-in template. If the template does not exist we will raise an error.
      - Once the policy has been created, this value cannot change.
      - The C(Comprehensive), C(Drupal), C(Fundamental), C(Joomla),
        C(Vulnerability Assessment Baseline), and C(Wordpress) templates are only available
        on BIG-IP versions >= 13.
