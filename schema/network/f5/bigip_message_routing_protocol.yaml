short_description: Manage generic message parser profile.
description:
  - Manages generic message parser profile for use with the message routing framework.
version_added: 2.9
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the generic parser profile.
    required: True
    type: str
  description:
    description:
      - The user defined description of the generic parser profile.
    type: str
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this parser profile. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified,
        the default is the system-supplied C(genericmsg) profile.
    type: str
  disable_parser:
    description:
      - When C(yes), the generic message parser will be disabled ignoring all incoming packets and not directly
        send message data.
      - This mode supports iRule script protocol implementations that will generate messages from the incoming transport
        stream and send outgoing messages on the outgoing transport stream.
    type: bool
  max_egress_buffer:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum size of the send buffer in bytes. If the number of bytes in the send buffer for a
        connection exceeds this value, the generic message protocol will stop receiving outgoing messages from the
        router until the size of the size of the buffer drops below this setting.
      - The accepted range is between 0 and 4294967295 inclusive.
    type: int
  max_msg_size:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum size of a received message. If a message exceeds this size, the connection will be reset.
      - The accepted range is between 0 and 4294967295 inclusive.
    type: int
  msg_terminator:
    description:
      - The string of characters used to terminate a message. If the message-terminator is not specified,
        the generic message parser will not separate the input stream into messages.
    type: str
  no_response:
    description:
      - When set, matching of responses to requests is disabled.
    type: bool
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to create route object on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the route exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the route is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
