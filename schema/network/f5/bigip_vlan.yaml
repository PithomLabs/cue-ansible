  - Manage VLANs on a BIG-IP system
version_added: 2.2
options:
  description:
    description:
      - The description to give to the VLAN.
    type: str
  tagged_interfaces:
    description:
      - Specifies a list of tagged interfaces and trunks that you want to
        configure for the VLAN. Use tagged interfaces or trunks when
        you want to assign a single interface or trunk to multiple VLANs.
      - This parameter is mutually exclusive with the C(untagged_interfaces)
        and C(interfaces) parameters.
    type: list
    aliases:
      - tagged_interface
  untagged_interfaces:
    description:
      - Specifies a list of untagged interfaces and trunks that you want to
        configure for the VLAN.
      - This parameter is mutually exclusive with the C(tagged_interfaces)
        and C(interfaces) parameters.
    type: list
    aliases:
      - untagged_interface
  name:
    description:
      - The VLAN to manage. If the special VLAN C(ALL) is specified with
        the C(state) value of C(absent) then all VLANs will be removed.
    type: str
    required: True
  state:
    description:
      - The state of the VLAN on the system. When C(present), guarantees
        that the VLAN exists with the provided attributes. When C(absent),
        removes the VLAN from the system.
    type: str
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
    default: present
  tag:
    description:
      - Tag number for the VLAN. The tag number can be any integer between 1
        and 4094. The system automatically assigns a tag number if you do not
        specify a value.
    type: int
  mtu:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for traffic on this VLAN.
        When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        value used will be C(1500).
      - This number must be between 576 to 9198.
    type: int
    version_added: 2.5
  cmp_hash:
    description:
      - Specifies how the traffic on the VLAN will be disaggregated. The value
        selected determines the traffic disaggregation method. You can choose to
        disaggregate traffic based on C(source-address) (the source IP address),
        C(destination-address) (destination IP address), or C(default), which
        specifies that the default CMP hash uses L4 ports.
      - When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        of C(default) is used.
    type: str
    choices:
      - default
      - destination-address
      - source-address
      - dst-ip
      - src-ip
      - dest
      - destination
      - source
      - dst
      - src
    version_added: 2.5
  dag_tunnel:
    description:
      - Specifies how the disaggregator (DAG) distributes received tunnel-encapsulated
        packets to TMM instances. Select C(inner) to distribute packets based on information
        in inner headers. Select C(outer) to distribute packets based on information in
        outer headers without inspecting inner headers.
      - When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        of C(outer) is used.
      - This parameter is not supported on Virtual Editions of BIG-IP.
    type: str
    choices:
      - inner
      - outer
    version_added: 2.5
  dag_round_robin:
    description:
      - Specifies whether some of the stateless traffic on the VLAN should be
        disaggregated in a round-robin order instead of using a static hash. The
        stateless traffic includes non-IP L2 traffic, ICMP, some UDP protocols,
        and so on.
      - When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        of (no) is used.
    type: bool
    version_added: 2.5
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
    version_added: 2.5
  source_check:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that the system verifies that the return route to an initial
        packet is the same VLAN from which the packet originated.
      - The system performs this verification only if the C(auto_last_hop) option is C(no).
    type: bool
    version_added: 2.8
  fail_safe:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that the VLAN takes the specified C(fail_safe_action) if the
        system detects a loss of traffic on this VLAN's interfaces.
    type: bool
    version_added: 2.8
  fail_safe_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds that a system can run without detecting network
        traffic on this VLAN before it takes the C(fail_safe_action).
    type: int
    version_added: 2.8
  fail_safe_action:
    description:
      - Specifies the action that the system takes when it does not detect any traffic on
        this VLAN, and the C(fail_safe_timeout) has expired.
    type: str
    choices:
      - reboot
      - restart-all
      - failover
    version_added: 2.8
  sflow_poll_interval:
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum interval in seconds between two pollings.
    type: int
    version_added: 2.8
  sflow_sampling_rate:
    description:
      - Specifies the ratio of packets observed to the samples generated.
    type: int
    version_added: 2.8
  interfaces:
    description:
      - Interfaces that you want added to the VLAN. This can include both tagged
        and untagged interfaces as the C(tagging) parameter specifies.
      - This parameter is mutually exclusive with the C(untagged_interfaces) and
        C(tagged_interfaces) parameters.
    suboptions:
      interface:
        description:
          - The name of the interface
        type: str
      tagging:
        description:
          - Whether the interface is C(tagged) or C(untagged).
        type: str
        choices:
          - tagged
          - untagged
