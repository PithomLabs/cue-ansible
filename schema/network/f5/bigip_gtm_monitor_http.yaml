  - Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM http monitors.
version_added: 2.6
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Monitor name.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has
        been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the C(tcp)
        parent on the C(Common) partition.
    type: str
    default: /Common/http
  send:
    description:
      - The send string for the monitor call.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, the
        default of C(GET /\r\n) will be used.
    type: str
  receive:
    description:
      - The receive string for the monitor call.
    type: str
  ip:
    description:
      - IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'.
      - If this value is an IP address, then a C(port) number must be specified.
    type: str
  port:
    description:
      - Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not
        provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be
        '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535
        must be specified
    type: str
  interval:
    description:
      - The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this
        template will run.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the
        default value will be 30.
      - This value B(must) be less than the C(timeout) value.
    type: int
  timeout:
    description:
      - The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to
        the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time
        period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within
        the set time period, it is considered down. You can change this
        number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the
        interval number of seconds plus 1 second.
      - If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the
        default value will be 120.
    type: int
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the monitor exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the monitor is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
  probe_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request
        to the system.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(5).
    type: int
  ignore_down_response:
    description:
      - Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
      - When C(yes), specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of
        the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout is reached without the system receiving
        an up response, the system marks the object down.
      - When C(no), specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it
        receives a down response.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  transparent:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the monitor operates in transparent mode.
      - A monitor in transparent mode directs traffic through the associated pool members
        or nodes (usually a router or firewall) to the aliased destination (that is, it
        probes the C(ip)-C(port) combination specified in the monitor).
      - If the monitor cannot successfully reach the aliased destination, the pool member
        or node through which the monitor traffic was sent is marked down.
      - When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default
        value will be C(no).
    type: bool
  reverse:
    description:
      - Instructs the system to mark the target resource down when the test is successful.
        This setting is useful, for example, if the content on your web site home page is
        dynamic and changes frequently, you may want to set up a reverse ECV service check
        that looks for the string Error.
      - A match for this string means that the web server was down.
      - To use this option, you must specify values for C(send) and C(receive).
    type: bool
  target_username:
    description:
      - Specifies the user name, if the monitored target requires authentication.
    type: str
  target_password:
    description:
      - Specifies the password, if the monitored target requires authentication.
    type: str
  update_password:
    description:
      - C(always) will update passwords if the C(target_password) is specified.
      - C(on_create) will only set the password for newly created monitors.
    type: str
    choices:
      - always
      - on_create
    default: always
