module: bigip_profile_persistence_src_addr
short_description: Manage source address persistence profiles
description:
  - Manages source address persistence profiles.
version_added: 2.7
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of the profile.
    type: str
    required: True
  parent:
    description:
      - Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default
        is the system-supplied C(source_addr) profile.
    type: str
  match_across_services:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that all persistent connections from a client IP address that go
        to the same virtual IP address also go to the same node.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
        default is provided by the parent profile.
    type: bool
  match_across_virtuals:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that all persistent connections from the same client IP address
        go to the same node.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
        default is provided by the parent profile.
    type: bool
  match_across_pools:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that the system can use any pool that contains this persistence
        record.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
        default is provided by the parent profile.
    type: bool
  hash_algorithm:
    description:
      - Specifies the algorithm the system uses for hash persistence load balancing. The hash
        result is the input for the algorithm.
      - When C(default), specifies that the system uses the index of pool members to obtain the
        hash result for the input to the algorithm.
      - When C(carp), specifies that the system uses the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP)
        to obtain the hash result for the input to the algorithm.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
        default is provided by the parent profile.
    type: str
    choices:
      - default
      - carp
  entry_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the duration of the persistence entries.
      - When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
        default is provided by the parent profile.
      - To specify an indefinite timeout, use the value C(indefinite).
      - If specifying a numeric timeout, the value must be between C(1) and C(4294967295).
    type: str
  override_connection_limit:
    description:
      - When C(yes), specifies that the system allows you to specify that pool member connection
        limits will be overridden for persisted clients.
      - Per-virtual connection limits remain hard limits and are not overridden.
    type: bool
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
    type: str
    default: Common
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), ensures that the profile exists.
      - When C(absent), ensures the profile is removed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
