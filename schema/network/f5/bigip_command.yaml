module: bigip_command
short_description: Run TMSH and BASH commands on F5 devices
description:
  - Sends a TMSH or BASH command to an BIG-IP node and returns the results
    read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause
    the module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing
    out if the condition is not met.
  - This module is B(not) idempotent, nor will it ever be. It is intended as
    a stop-gap measure to satisfy automation requirements until such a time as
    a real module has been developed to configure in the way you need.
  - If you are using this module, you should probably also be filing an issue
    to have a B(real) module created for your needs.
version_added: 2.4
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - The commands to send to the remote BIG-IP device over the
        configured provider. The resulting output from the command
        is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retries as expired.
      - Only C(tmsh) commands are supported. If you are piping or adding additional
        logic that is outside of C(tmsh) (such as grep'ing, awk'ing or other shell
        related things that are not C(tmsh), this behavior is not supported.
    required: True
    type: raw
  wait_for:
    description:
      - Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command
        and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause
        the task to wait for a particular conditional to be true
        before moving forward. If the conditional is not true
        by the configured retries, the task fails. See examples.
    type: list
    aliases: ['waitfor']
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
        I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy. Valid
        values are C(all) or C(any). If the value is set to C(all)
        then all conditionals in the I(wait_for) must be satisfied. If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
        satisfied.
    type: str
    choices:
      - any
      - all
    default: all
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the I(wait_for)
        conditionals.
    type: int
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditional, the interval indicates how to long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    type: int
    default: 1
  transport:
    description:
      - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the
        remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the
        device over cli (ssh) or rest.
    required: true
    choices:
        - rest
        - cli
    default: rest

  warn:
    description:
      - Whether the module should raise warnings related to command idempotency
        or not.
      - Note that the F5 Ansible developers specifically leave this on to make you
        aware that your usage of this module may be better served by official F5
        Ansible modules. This module should always be used as a last resort.
