module: bigip_configsync_action
short_description: Perform different actions related to config-sync
description:
  - Allows one to run different config-sync actions. These actions allow
    you to manually sync your configuration across multiple BIG-IPs when
    those devices are in an HA pair.
version_added: 2.4
options:
  device_group:
    description:
      - The device group that you want to perform config-sync actions on.
    type: str
    required: True
  sync_device_to_group:
    description:
      - Specifies that the system synchronizes configuration data from this
        device to other members of the device group. In this case, the device
        will do a "push" to all the other devices in the group. This option
        is mutually exclusive with the C(sync_group_to_device) option.
    type: bool
  sync_most_recent_to_device:
    description:
      - Specifies that the system synchronizes configuration data from the
        device with the most recent configuration. In this case, the device
        will do a "pull" from the most recently updated device. This option
        is mutually exclusive with the C(sync_device_to_group) options.
    type: bool
  overwrite_config:
    description:
      - Indicates that the sync operation overwrites the configuration on
        the target.
    type: bool
    default: no

  - Requires the objectpath Python package on the host. This is as easy as
    C(pip install objectpath).
