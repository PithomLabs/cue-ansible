description:
  - Manage SNAT Translations on a BIG-IP.
version_added: 2.9
options:
  address:
    description:
      - Specifies the IP address of the SNAT translation. When a C(state) of present, enabled, or disabled is
        provided, this parameter is required.
      - This parameter cannot be updated after it is set.
    type: str
    aliases:
      - ip
  arp:
    description:
      - If C(yes), specifies that the NAT sends ARP requests.
    type: bool
  connection_limit:
    description:
      - Specifies a limit on the number of connections a translation address must reach before it no longer
        initiates a connection. The default value of 0 indicates that the setting is disabled.
      - The accepted value range is C(0 - 65535).
    type: int
  description:
    description:
      - Description of snat-translation. C(none or '') will set to default description of null.
    type: str
  ip_idle_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time that connections to an IP address initiated using a SNAT address are
        allowed to remain idle before being automatically disconnected. C(indefinite) prevents the connection
        from timing out.
      - The accepted value range is C(0 - 4294967295) seconds, specifying C(indefinite) will
        set it to the maximum value.
    type: str
  name:
    description:
      - The name of SNAT translation.
    type: str
    required: True
  partition:
    description:
      - Device partition to manage resources on.
      - Required with state C(absent) when partition other than Common used.
    type: str
  state:
    description:
      - The SNAT translation state. If C(absent), delete the SNAT translation
        if it exists. C(present) creates the SNAT translation and enable it.
        If C(enabled), enable the SNAT translation if it exists. If C(disabled),
        create the SNAT translation if needed, and set state to C(disabled).
    type: str
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - enabled
      - disabled
    default: present
  tcp_idle_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time that TCP connections initiated using a SNAT address are allowed
        to remain idle before being automatically disconnected. C(indefinite) Prevents the
        connection from timing out.
      - The accepted value range is C(0 - 4294967295) seconds, specifying C(indefinite) will
        set it to the maximum value.
    type: str
  traffic_group:
    description:
      - The traffic group for the snat-translation address. When creating a new address,
        if this value is not specified, the default of C(/Common/traffic-group-1)
        will be used.
    type: str
  udp_idle_timeout:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time that UDP connections initiated using a SNAT address are allowed
        to remain idle before being automatically disconnected. C(indefinite) Prevents the connection
        from timing out.
      - The accepted value range is C(0 - 4294967295) seconds, specifying C(indefinite) will
        set it to the maximum value.
