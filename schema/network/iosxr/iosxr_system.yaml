short_description: Manage the system attributes on Cisco IOS XR devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of node system attributes
    on Cisco IOS XR devices. It provides an option to configure host system
    parameters or remove those parameters from the device active
    configuration.
requirements:
    - ncclient >= 0.5.3 when using netconf
    - lxml >= 4.1.1 when using netconf
extends_documentation_fragment: iosxr
notes:
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli) and C(netconf). See L(the IOS-XR Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_iosxr.html).
  - Tested against IOS XRv 6.1.3
  - name-servers I(state=absent) operation with C(netconf) transport is a success, but with rpc-error. This is
    due to XR platform issue. Recommended to use I(ignore_errors) option with the task as a workaround.
options:
  hostname:
    description:
      - Configure the device hostname parameter. This option takes an ASCII string value.

  domain_name:
    description:
      - Configure the IP domain name
        on the remote device to the provided value. Value
        should be in the dotted name form and will be

        domain name.
  domain_search:
    description:

  lookup_source:
    description:
      - The C(lookup_source) argument provides one or more source
        interfaces to use for performing DNS lookups.  The interface
        provided in C(lookup_source) must be a valid interface configured
        on the device.
  lookup_enabled:
    description:
      - Provides administrative control
        for enabling or disabling DNS lookups.  When this argument is
        set to True, lookups are performed and when it is set to False,
        lookups are not performed.
    type: bool
  name_servers:
    description:
      - The C(name_serves) argument accepts a list of DNS name servers by
        way of either FQDN or IP address to use to perform name resolution

        examples.
  state:
    description:
      - State of the configuration
        values in the device's current active configuration.  When set
        to I(present), the values should be configured in the device active
        configuration and when set to I(absent) the values should not be
        in the device active configuration
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
