module: junos_command
version_added: "2.1"
author: "Peter Sprygada (@privateip)"
short_description: Run arbitrary commands on an Juniper JUNOS device
description:
  - Sends an arbitrary set of commands to an JUNOS node and returns the results
    read from the device.  This module includes an
    argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
    before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
extends_documentation_fragment: junos
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - The commands to send to the remote junos device over the
        configured provider.  The resulting output from the command
        is returned.  If the I(wait_for) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of I(retries) has been exceeded.
  rpcs:
    description:
      - The C(rpcs) argument accepts a list of RPCs to be executed
        over a netconf session and the results from the RPC execution
        is return to the playbook via the modules results dictionary.
    version_added: "2.3"
  wait_for:
    description:
      - Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command
        and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause
        the task to wait for a particular conditional to be true
        before moving forward.   If the conditional is not true
        by the configured retries, the task fails.  See examples.
    aliases: ['waitfor']
    version_added: "2.2"
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
        I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy.  Valid
        values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value is set to C(all)
        then all conditionals in the I(wait_for) must be satisfied.  If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
        satisfied.
    default: all
    choices: ['any', 'all']
    version_added: "2.2"
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried
        before it is considered failed.  The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the I(wait_for)
        conditionals.
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command.  If the command does not pass the specified
        conditional, the interval indicates how to long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    default: 1
  display:
    description:
      - Encoding scheme to use when serializing output from the device.
        This handles how to properly understand the output and apply the
        conditionals path to the result set. For I(rpcs) argument default
        display is C(xml) and for I(commands) argument default display
        is C(text). Value C(set) is applicable only for fetching configuration
        from device.
    default: depends on input argument I(rpcs) or I(commands)
    aliases: ['format', 'output']
    choices: ['text', 'json', 'xml', 'set']
    version_added: "2.3"
requirements:
  - jxmlease
  - ncclient (>=v0.5.2)
notes:
  - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on
    the remote device being managed.
  - Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
  - Recommended connection is C(netconf). See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
  - This module also works with C(network_cli) connections and with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
