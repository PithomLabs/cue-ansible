version_added: '2.7'
options:
  tenant:
    description:
    - The name of the Tenant the OSPF interface policy should belong to.
    type: str
    required: yes
    aliases: [ tenant_name ]
  ospf:
    description:
    - The OSPF interface policy name.
    - This name can be between 1 and 64 alphanumeric characters.
    - Note that you cannot change this name after the object has been saved.
    type: str
    required: yes
    aliases: [ ospf_interface, name ]
  description:
    description:
    - The description for the OSPF interface.
    type: str
    aliases: [ descr ]
  network_type:
    description:
    - The OSPF interface policy network type.
    - OSPF supports broadcast and point-to-point.
    - The APIC defaults to C(unspecified) when unset during creation.
    type: str
    choices: [ bcast, p2p ]
  cost:
    description:
    - The OSPF cost of the interface.
    - The cost (also called metric) of an interface in OSPF is an indication of
      the overhead required to send packets across a certain interface. The
      cost of an interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that
      interface. A higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. There is more
      overhead (higher cost) and time delays involved in crossing a 56k serial
      line than crossing a 10M ethernet line. The formula used to calculate the
      cost is C(cost= 10000 0000/bandwith in bps) For example, it will cost
      10 EXP8/10 EXP7 = 10 to cross a 10M Ethernet line and will cost
      10 EXP8/1544000 = 64 to cross a T1 line.
    - By default, the cost of an interface is calculated based on the bandwidth;
      you can force the cost of an interface with the ip ospf cost value
      interface subconfiguration mode command.
    - Accepted values range between C(1) and C(450).
    - The APIC defaults to C(0) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  controls:
    description:
    - The interface policy controls.
    - 'This is a list of one or more of the following controls:'
    - C(advert-subnet) -- Advertise IP subnet instead of a host mask in the router LSA.
    - C(bfd) -- Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    - C(mtu-ignore) -- Disables MTU mismatch detection on an interface.
    - C(passive) -- The interface does not participate in the OSPF protocol and
      will not establish adjacencies or send routing updates. However the
      interface is announced as part of the routing network.
    type: list
    choices: [ advert-subnet, bfd, mtu-ignore, passive ]
  dead_interval:
    description:
    - The interval between hello packets from a neighbor before the router
      declares the neighbor as down.
    - This value must be the same for all networking devices on a specific network.
    - Specifying a smaller dead interval (seconds) will give faster detection
      of a neighbor being down and improve convergence, but might cause more
      routing instability.
    - Accepted values range between C(1) and C(65535).
    - The APIC defaults to C(40) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  hello_interval:
    description:
    - The interval between hello packets that OSPF sends on the interface.
    - Note that the smaller the hello interval, the faster topological changes will be detected, but more routing traffic will ensue.
    - This value must be the same for all routers and access servers on a specific network.
    - Accepted values range between C(1) and C(65535).
    - The APIC defaults to C(10) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  prefix_suppression:
    description:
    - Whether prefix suppressions is enabled or disabled.
    - The APIC defaults to C(inherit) when unset during creation.
    type: bool
  priority:
    description:
    - The priority for the OSPF interface profile.
    - Accepted values ranges between C(0) and C(255).
    - The APIC defaults to C(1) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  retransmit_interval:
    description:
    - The interval between LSA retransmissions.
    - The retransmit interval occurs while the router is waiting for an acknowledgement from the neighbor router that it received the LSA.
    - If no acknowledgment is received at the end of the interval, then the LSA is resent.
    - Accepted values range between C(1) and C(65535).
    - The APIC defaults to C(5) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  transmit_delay:
    description:
    - The delay time needed to send an LSA update packet.
    - OSPF increments the LSA age time by the transmit delay amount before transmitting the LSA update.
    - You should take into account the transmission and propagation delays for the interface when you set this value.
    - Accepted values range between C(1) and C(450).
    - The APIC defaults to C(1) when unset during creation.
    type: int
  state:
    description:
    - Use C(present) or C(absent) for adding or removing.
    - Use C(query) for listing an object or multiple objects.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present, query ]
    default: present
