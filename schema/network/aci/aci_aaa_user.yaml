notes:
- This module is not idempotent when C(aaa_password) is being used
  (even if that password was already set identically). This
  appears to be an inconsistency wrt. the idempotent nature
  of the APIC REST API. The vendor has been informed.
  More information in :ref:`the ACI documentation <aci_guide_known_issues>`.
