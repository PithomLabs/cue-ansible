short_description: Execute arbitrary commands on a PAN-OS device using XPath and element
description:
  - Run an arbitrary 'xapi' command taking an XPath (i.e get) or XPath and element (i.e set).
  - See https://github.com/kevinsteves/pan-python/blob/master/doc/pan.xapi.rst for details
  - Runs a 'set' command by default
  - This should support _all_ commands that your PAN-OS device accepts vi it's cli
  - cli commands are found as
  - Once logged in issue 'debug cli on'
  - Enter configuration mode by issuing 'configure'
  - Enter your set (or other) command, for example 'set deviceconfig system timezone Australia/Melbourne'
  - returns
  - >
    "<request cmd="set"
    obj="/config/devices/entry[@name='localhost.localdomain']/deviceconfig/system"
    cookie=XXXX><timezone>Australia/Melbourne</timezone></request>
  - The 'xpath' is  "/config/devices/entry[@name='localhost.localdomain']/deviceconfig/system"
  - The 'element' is "<timezone>Australia/Melbourne</timezone>"
