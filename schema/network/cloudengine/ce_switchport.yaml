    - Manages Layer 2 switchport interfaces on HUAWEI CloudEngine switches.

notes:
    - When C(state=absent), VLANs can be added/removed from trunk links and
      the existing access VLAN can be 'unconfigured' to just having VLAN 1 on that interface.
    - When working with trunks VLANs the keywords add/remove are always sent
      in the C(port trunk allow-pass vlan) command. Use verbose mode to see commands sent.
    - When C(state=unconfigured), the interface will result with having a default Layer 2 interface, i.e. vlan 1 in access mode.
    - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
    - Recommended connection is C(netconf).
    - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
