    - Manages BFD global configuration on HUAWEI CloudEngine devices.
author: QijunPan (@QijunPan)
notes:
  - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
  - Recommended connection is C(netconf).
  - This module also works with C(local) connections for legacy playbooks.
options:
    bfd_enable:
        description:
            - Enables the global Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) function.
        choices: ['enable', 'disable']
    default_ip:
        description:
            - Specifies the default multicast IP address.
              The value ranges from 224.0.0.107 to 224.0.0.250.
    tos_exp_dynamic:
        description:
            - Indicates the priority of BFD control packets for dynamic BFD sessions.
              The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 7.
              The default priority is 7, which is the highest priority of BFD control packets.
    tos_exp_static:
        description:
            - Indicates the priority of BFD control packets for static BFD sessions.
              The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 7.
              The default priority is 7, which is the highest priority of BFD control packets.
    damp_init_wait_time:
        description:
            - Specifies an initial flapping suppression time for a BFD session.
              The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 3600000, in milliseconds.
              The default value is 2000.
    damp_max_wait_time:
        description:
            - Specifies a maximum flapping suppression time for a BFD session.
              The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 3600000, in milliseconds.
              The default value is 15000.
    damp_second_wait_time:
        description:
            - Specifies a secondary flapping suppression time for a BFD session.
              The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 3600000, in milliseconds.
              The default value is 5000.
    delay_up_time:
        description:
            - Specifies the delay before a BFD session becomes Up.
              The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 600, in seconds.
              The default value is 0, indicating that a BFD session immediately becomes Up.
    state:
        description:
            - Determines whether the config should be present or not on the device.
        default: present
        choices: ['present', 'absent']
