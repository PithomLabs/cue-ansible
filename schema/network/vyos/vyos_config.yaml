version_added: "2.2"
author: "Nathaniel Case (@Qalthos)"
short_description: Manage VyOS configuration on remote device
description:
  - This module provides configuration file management of VyOS
    devices. It provides arguments for managing both the
    configuration file and state of the active configuration. All
    configuration statements are based on `set` and `delete` commands
    in the device configuration.
extends_documentation_fragment: vyos
notes:
  - Tested against VyOS 1.1.8 (helium).
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli). See L(the VyOS OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_vyos.html).
options:
  lines:
    description:
      - The ordered set of configuration lines to be managed and
        compared with the existing configuration on the remote
        device.
  src:
    description:
      - The C(src) argument specifies the path to the source config
        file to load.  The source config file can either be in
        bracket format or set format.  The source file can include
        Jinja2 template variables.
  match:
    description:
      - The C(match) argument controls the method used to match
        against the current active configuration.  By default, the
        desired config is matched against the active config and the
        deltas are loaded.  If the C(match) argument is set to C(none)
        the active configuration is ignored and the configuration is
        always loaded.
    default: line
    choices: ['line', 'none']
  backup:
    description:
      - The C(backup) argument will backup the current devices active
        configuration to the Ansible control host prior to making any
        changes. If the C(backup_options) value is not given, the
        backup file will be located in the backup folder in the playbook
        root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an
        ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  comment:
    description:
      - Allows a commit description to be specified to be included
        when the configuration is committed.  If the configuration is
        not changed or committed, this argument is ignored.
    default: 'configured by vyos_config'
  config:
    description:
      - The C(config) argument specifies the base configuration to use
        to compare against the desired configuration.  If this value
        is not specified, the module will automatically retrieve the
        current active configuration from the remote device.
  save:
    description:
      - The C(save) argument controls whether or not changes made
        to the active configuration are saved to disk.  This is
        independent of committing the config.  When set to True, the
        active configuration is saved.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  backup_options:
    description:
      - This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path.
        The value of this option is read only when C(backup) is set to I(yes), if C(backup) is set
        to I(no) this option will be silently ignored.
    suboptions:
      filename:
        description:
          - The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename
            is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
            in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
      dir_path:
        description:
          - This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup
            configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be first
            created and the filename is either the value of C(filename) or default filename
            as described in C(filename) options description. If the path value is not given
            in that case a I(backup) directory will be created in the current working directory
            and backup configuration will be copied in C(filename) within I(backup) directory.
