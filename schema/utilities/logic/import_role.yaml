module: import_role
short_description: Import a role into a play
description:
  - Much like the C(roles:) keyword, this task loads a role, but it allows you to control when the role tasks run in
    between other tasks of the play.
  - Most keywords, loops and conditionals will only be applied to the imported tasks, not to this statement itself. If
    you want the opposite behavior, use M(include_role) instead.
version_added: '2.4'
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the role to be executed.
    type: str
    required: true
  tasks_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(tasks/) directory.
    type: str
    default: main
  vars_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(vars/) directory.
    type: str
    default: main
  defaults_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(defaults/) directory.
    type: str
    default: main
  allow_duplicates:
    description:
      - Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  handlers_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(handlers/) directory.
    type: str
    default: main
    version_added: '2.8'
notes:
  - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
  - Since Ansible 2.7 variables defined in C(vars) and C(defaults) for the role are exposed at playbook parsing time.
    Due to this, these variables will be accessible to roles and tasks executed before the location of the
    M(import_role) task.
  - Unlike M(include_role) variable exposure is not configurable, and will always be exposed.
