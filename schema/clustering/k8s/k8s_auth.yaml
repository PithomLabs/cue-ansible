short_description: Authenticate to Kubernetes clusters which require an explicit login step

version_added: "2.8"

author: KubeVirt Team (@kubevirt)

description:
  - "This module handles authenticating to Kubernetes clusters requiring I(explicit) authentication procedures,
    meaning ones where a client logs in (obtains an authentication token), performs API operations using said
    token and then logs out (revokes the token). An example of a Kubernetes distribution requiring this module
    is OpenShift."
  - "On the other hand a popular configuration for username+password authentication is one utilizing HTTP Basic
    Auth, which does not involve any additional login/logout steps (instead login credentials can be attached
    to each and every API call performed) and as such is handled directly by the C(k8s) module (and other
    resourceâ€“specific modules) by utilizing the C(host), C(username) and C(password) parameters. Please
    consult your preferred module's documentation for more details."
