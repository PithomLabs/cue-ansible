description:
  - Manage installation and Gem version dependencies for Ruby using the Bundler gem
version_added: "2.0.0"
options:
  executable:
    description:
      - The path to the bundler executable
  state:
    description:
      - The desired state of the Gem bundle. C(latest) updates gems to the most recent, acceptable version
    choices: [present, latest]
    default: present
  chdir:
    description:
      - The directory to execute the bundler commands from. This directory
        needs to contain a valid Gemfile or .bundle/ directory
    default: temporary working directory
  exclude_groups:
    description:
      - A list of Gemfile groups to exclude during operations. This only
        applies when state is C(present). Bundler considers this
        a 'remembered' property for the Gemfile and will automatically exclude
        groups in future operations even if C(exclude_groups) is not set
  clean:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). If set removes any gems on the
        target host that are not in the gemfile
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  gemfile:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). The path to the gemfile to use to install gems.
    default: Gemfile in current directory
  local:
    description:
      - If set only installs gems from the cache on the target host
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  deployment_mode:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). If set it will install gems in
        ./vendor/bundle instead of the default location. Requires a Gemfile.lock
        file to have been created prior
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  user_install:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). Installs gems in the local user's cache or for all users
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
  gem_path:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). Specifies the directory to
        install the gems into. If C(chdir) is set then this path is relative to
        C(chdir)
    default: RubyGems gem paths
  binstub_directory:
    description:
      - Only applies if state is C(present). Specifies the directory to
        install any gem bins files to. When executed the bin files will run
        within the context of the Gemfile and fail if any required gem
        dependencies are not installed. If C(chdir) is set then this path is
        relative to C(chdir)
  extra_args:
    description:
      - A space separated string of additional commands that can be applied to
        the Bundler command. Refer to the Bundler documentation for more
