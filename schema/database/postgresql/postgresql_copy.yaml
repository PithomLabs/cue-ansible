  session_role:
    description:

      the session_role were the one that had logged in originally.
    type: str

notes:
- Supports PostgreSQL version 9.4+.
- COPY command is only allowed to database superusers.
- if I(check_mode=yes), we just check the src/dst table availability
  and return the COPY query that actually has not been executed.
- If i(check_mode=yes) and the source has been passed as SQL, the module
  will execute it and rolled the transaction back but pay attention
  it can affect database performance (e.g., if SQL collects a lot of data).
