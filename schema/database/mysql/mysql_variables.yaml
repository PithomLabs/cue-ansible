    - C(global) assigns C(value) to a global system variable which will be changed at runtime
      but won't persist across server restarts.
    - C(persist) assigns C(value) to a global system variable and persists it to
      the mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data directory
      (the variable will survive service restarts).
    - C(persist_only) persists C(value) to the mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data directory
      but without setting the global variable runtime value
      (the value will be changed after the next service restart).
