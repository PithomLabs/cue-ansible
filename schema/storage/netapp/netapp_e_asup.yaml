    - Enabling ASUP will allow our support teams to monitor the logs of the storage-system in order to proactively
      respond to issues with the system. It is recommended that all ASUP-related options be enabled, but they may be
      disabled if desired.
    - This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.0 and higher.
