- Modify Volume AutoSize
options:
  volume:
    description:
    - The name of the flexible volume for which we want to set autosize.
    type: str
    required: true

  mode:
    description:
    - Specify the flexible volume's autosize mode of operation.
    type: str
    choices: ['grow', 'grow_shrink', 'off']

  vserver:
    description:
    - Name of the vserver to use.
    required: true
    type: str

  grow_threshold_percent:
    description:
    - Specifies the percentage of the flexible volume's capacity at which autogrow is initiated.
    - The default grow threshold varies from 85% to 98%, depending on the volume size.
    - It is an error for the grow threshold to be less than or equal to the shrink threshold.
    - Range between 0 and 100
    type: int

  increment_size:
    description:
    - Specify the flexible volume's increment size using the following format < number > [k|m|g|t]
    - The amount is the absolute size to set.
    - The trailing 'k', 'm', 'g', and 't' indicates the desired units, namely 'kilobytes', 'megabytes', 'gigabytes', and 'terabytes' (respectively).
    type: str

  maximum_size:
    description:
    - Specify the flexible volume's maximum allowed size using the following format < number > [k|m|g|t]
    - The amount is the absolute size to set.
    - The trailing 'k', 'm', 'g', and 't' indicates the desired units, namely 'kilobytes', 'megabytes', 'gigabytes', and 'terabytes' (respectively).
    - The default value is 20% greater than the volume size at the time autosize was enabled.
    - It is an error for the maximum volume size to be less than the current volume size.
    - It is also an error for the maximum size to be less than or equal to the minimum size.
    type: str

  minimum_size:
    description:
    - Specify the flexible volume's minimum allowed size using the following format < number > [k|m|g|t] The amount is the absolute size to set.
    - The trailing 'k', 'm', 'g', and 't' indicates the desired units, namely 'kilobytes', 'megabytes', 'gigabytes', and 'terabytes' (respectively).
    - The default value is the size of the volume at the time the 'grow_shrink' mode was enabled.
    - It is an error for the minimum size to be greater than or equal to the maximum size.
    type: str

  reset:
    description:
    - "Sets the values of maximum_size, increment_size, minimum_size, grow_threshold_percent, shrink_threshold_percent and mode to their defaults"
    type: bool

  shrink_threshold_percent:
    description:
    - Specifies the percentage of the flexible volume's capacity at which autoshrink is initiated.
    - The default shrink threshold is 50%. It is an error for the shrink threshold to be greater than or equal to the grow threshold.
    - Range between 0 and 100
    type: int
