      the scheme ldap:// or ldaps:// (for LDAP over SSL), a hostname, and a
      domain name or IP address. For example, ldap://ad.company.com configures
      the directory service with the hostname "ad" in the domain "company.com"
      while specifying the unencrypted LDAP protocol.
  base_dn:
    type: str
    description:
    - Sets the base of the Distinguished Name (DN) of the directory service
      groups. The base should consist of only Domain Components (DCs). The
      base_dn will populate with a default value when a URI is entered by
      parsing domain components from the URI. The base DN should specify DC=
      for each domain component and multiple DCs should be separated by commas.

  group_base:
    type: str
    description:
    - Specifies where the configured groups are located in the directory
      tree. This field consists of Organizational Units (OUs) that combine
      with the base DN attribute and the configured group CNs to complete
      the full Distinguished Name of the groups. The group base should
      specify OU= for each OU and multiple OUs should be separated by commas.
      The order of OUs is important and should get larger in scope from left
      to right. Each OU should not exceed 64 characters in length.
