description:
- This module gathers information on a specific system using its HP iLO interface.
  These information includes hardware and network related information useful
  for provisioning (e.g. macaddress, uuid).
- This module requires the C(hpilo) python module.
- This module was called C(hpilo_facts) before Ansible 2.9, returning C(ansible_facts).
  Note that the M(hpilo_info) module no longer returns C(ansible_facts)!

  interface directly, either by using C(local_action) or using C(delegate_to).
