version_added: "2.4"
short_description: Manage Docker volumes
description:
  - Create/remove Docker volumes.
  - Performs largely the same function as the "docker volume" CLI subcommand.
options:
  volume_name:
    description:
      - Name of the volume to operate on.
    type: str
    required: yes
    aliases:
      - name

  driver:
    description:
      - Specify the type of volume. Docker provides the C(local) driver, but 3rd party drivers can also be used.
    type: str
    default: local

  driver_options:
    description:
      - "Dictionary of volume settings. Consult docker docs for valid options and values:
        U(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/#driver-specific-options)"
    type: dict

  labels:
    description:
      - Dictionary of label key/values to set for the volume
    type: dict

  force:
    description:
      - With state C(present) causes the volume to be deleted and recreated if the volume already
        exist and the driver, driver options or labels differ. This will cause any data in the existing
        volume to be lost.
      - Deprecated. Will be removed in Ansible 2.12. Set I(recreate) to C(options-changed) instead
        for the same behavior of setting I(force) to C(yes).
    type: bool
    default: no

  recreate:
    version_added: "2.8"
    description:
      - Controls when a volume will be recreated when I(state) is C(present). Please
        note that recreating an existing volume will cause **any data in the existing volume
        to be lost!** The volume will be deleted and a new volume with the same name will be
        created.
      - The value C(always) forces the volume to be always recreated.
      - The value C(never) makes sure the volume will not be recreated.
      - The value C(options-changed) makes sure the volume will be recreated if the volume
        already exist and the driver, driver options or labels differ.
    type: str
    default: never
    choices:
    - always
    - never
    - options-changed

  state:
    description:
      - C(absent) deletes the volume.
      - C(present) creates the volume, if it does not already exist.
    type: str
    default: present
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
