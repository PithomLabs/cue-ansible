author:
- Peter Sprygada (@privateip)
notes:
- VMware sold their vCloud Air service in Q2 2017.
- VMware made significant changes to the pyvcloud interface around this time.  The C(vca_vapp) module relies on now deprecated code.
- Mileage with C(vca_vapp) may vary as vCloud Director APIs advance.
- A viable alternative maybe U(https://github.com/vmware/ansible-module-vcloud-director)
