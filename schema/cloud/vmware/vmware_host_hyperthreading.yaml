short_description: Enables/Disables Hyperthreading optimization for an ESXi host system
description:
- This module can be used to enable or disable Hyperthreading optimization for ESXi host systems in given vCenter infrastructure.
- It also checks if Hyperthreading is activated/deactivated and if the host needs to be restarted.
