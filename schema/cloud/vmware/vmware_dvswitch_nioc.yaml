             limit: The maximum allowed usage for a traffic class belonging to this resource pool per host physical NIC.
                    reservation: (Ignored if NIOC version is set to version2) Amount of bandwidth resource that is
                    guaranteed available to the host infrastructure traffic class. If the utilization is less than the
                    reservation, the extra bandwidth is used for other host infrastructure traffic class types.
                    Reservation is not allowed to exceed the value of limit, if limit is set. Unit is Mbits/sec.
             shares_level: The allocation level ("low", "normal", "high", "custom"). The level is a simplified view
                           of shares. Levels map to a pre-determined set of numeric values for shares.
             shares: Ignored unless shares_level is "custom".  The number of shares allocated.
             reservation: Ignored unless version is "version3". Amount of bandwidth resource that is guaranteed
                          available to the host infrastructure traffic class.
