module: vmware_vmkernel
short_description: Manages a VMware VMkernel Adapter of an ESXi host.
description:
    - This module can be used to manage the VMKernel adapters / VMKernel network interfaces of an ESXi host.
    - The module assumes that the host is already configured with the Port Group in case of a vSphere Standard Switch (vSS).
    - The module assumes that the host is already configured with the Distributed Port Group in case of a vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS).
    - The module automatically migrates the VMKernel adapter from vSS to vDS or vice versa if present.

notes:
    - The option C(device) need to be used with DHCP because otherwise it's not possible to check if a VMkernel device is already present
    - You can only change from DHCP to static, and vSS to vDS, or vice versa, in one step, without creating a new device, with C(device) specified.
    - You can only create the VMKernel adapter on a vDS if authenticated to vCenter and not if authenticated to ESXi.
    - Tested on vSphere 5.5 and 6.5
requirements:
    - "python >= 2.6"
