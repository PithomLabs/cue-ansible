module: cs_ip_address
short_description: Manages public IP address associations on Apache CloudStack based clouds.
description:
    - Acquires and associates a public IP to an account or project.
    - Due to API limitations this is not an idempotent call, so be sure to only
      conditionally call this when I(state=present).
    - Tagging the IP address can also make the call idempotent.
