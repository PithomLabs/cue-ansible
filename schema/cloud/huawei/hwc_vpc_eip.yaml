            charge_mode:
                description:
                    - Specifies whether the bandwidth is billed by traffic or
                      by bandwidth size. The value can be bandwidth or traffic.
                      If this parameter is left blank or is null character
                      string, default value bandwidth is used. For IPv6
                      addresses, the default parameter value is bandwidth
                      outside China and is traffic in China.

            name:
                description:
                    - Specifies the bandwidth name. The value is a string of 1
                      to 64 characters that can contain letters, digits,

                    - Specifies the bandwidth size. The value ranges from 1
                      Mbit/s to 2000 Mbit/s by default. (The specific range may
                      vary depending on the configuration in each region. You
                      can see the bandwidth range of each region on the
                      management console.) The minimum unit for bandwidth
                      adjustment varies depending on the bandwidth range. The
                      details are as follows.
                    - The minimum unit is 1 Mbit/s if the allowed bandwidth
                      size ranges from 0 to 300 Mbit/s (with 300 Mbit/s
                      included).
                    - The minimum unit is 50 Mbit/s if the allowed bandwidth
                      size ranges 300 Mbit/s to 1000 Mbit/s (with 1000 Mbit/s
                      included).
                    - The minimum unit is 500 Mbit/s if the allowed bandwidth
                      size is greater than 1000 Mbit/s.
