description:
    - Gather infos about your Hetzner Cloud servers.
    - This module was called C(hcloud_server_facts) before Ansible 2.9, returning C(ansible_facts) and C(hcloud_server_facts).
      Note that the M(hcloud_server_info) module no longer returns C(ansible_facts) and the value was renamed to C(hcloud_server_info)!
