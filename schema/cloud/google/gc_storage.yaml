description:
    - This module allows users to manage their objects/buckets in Google Cloud Storage.  It allows upload and download operations and can set some
      canned permissions. It also allows retrieval of URLs for objects for use in playbooks, and retrieval of string contents of objects.  This module
      requires setting the default project in GCS prior to playbook usage.  See U(https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/reference/v1/apiversion1) for
      information about setting the default project.
