module: gcp_compute_network_endpoint_group
description:
- Network endpoint groups (NEGs) are zonal resources that represent collections of
  IP address and port combinations for GCP resources within a single subnet. Each
  IP address and port combination is called a network endpoint.
- Network endpoint groups can be used as backends in backend services for HTTP(S),
  TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers. You cannot use NEGs as a backend with internal
  load balancers. Because NEG backends allow you to specify IP addresses and ports,
  you can distribute traffic in a granular fashion among applications or containers
  running within VM instances.

  name:
    description:
    - Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The
      name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
      name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash.
