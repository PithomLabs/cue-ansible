module: gcp_compute_reservation
description:
- Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is held in
  a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.
- Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google Kubernetes
  Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or `g1-small` machine types,
  preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other services not listed above like Cloud
  SQL and Dataflow.
