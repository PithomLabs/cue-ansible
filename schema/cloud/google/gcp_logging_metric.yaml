module: gcp_logging_metric
description:
- Logs-based metric can also be used to extract values from logs and create a a distribution
  of the values. The distribution records the statistics of the extracted values along
  with an optional histogram of the values as specified by the bucket options.

  value_extractor:
    description:
    - A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to
      extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for
      value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument
      are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be
      extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (U(https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax))
      with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field.
      The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It
      is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.
