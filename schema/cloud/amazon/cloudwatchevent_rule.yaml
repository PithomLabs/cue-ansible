short_description: Manage CloudWatch Event rules and targets
description:
  - This module creates and manages CloudWatch event rules and targets.
version_added: "2.2"
extends_documentation_fragment:

author: "Jim Dalton (@jsdalton) <jim.dalton@gmail.com>"
requirements:
  - python >= 2.6
  - boto3
notes:
  - A rule must contain at least an I(event_pattern) or I(schedule_expression). A
    rule can have both an I(event_pattern) and a I(schedule_expression), in which
    case the rule will trigger on matching events as well as on a schedule.
  - When specifying targets, I(input) and I(input_path) are mutually-exclusive
    and optional parameters.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the rule you are creating, updating or deleting. No spaces
        or special characters allowed (i.e. must match C([\.\-_A-Za-z0-9]+)).
    required: true
    type: str
  schedule_expression:
    description:
      - A cron or rate expression that defines the schedule the rule will
        trigger on. For example, C(cron(0 20 * * ? *)), C(rate(5 minutes)).
    required: false

        incoming events to determine if the rule should be triggered.

      input:
        type: str
        description:
          - A JSON object that will override the event data when passed to the target.
          - If neither I(input) nor I(input_path) is specified, then the entire
            event is passed to the target in JSON form.
      input_path:
        type: str
        description:
          - A JSONPath string (e.g. C($.detail)) that specifies the part of the event data to be
            passed to the target.
