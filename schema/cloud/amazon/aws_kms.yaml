short_description: Perform various KMS management tasks.

     - Manage role/user access to a KMS key. Not designed for encrypting/decrypting.
version_added: "2.3"
options:
  alias:
    description: An alias for a key. For safety, even though KMS does not require keys
      to have an alias, this module expects all new keys to be given an alias
      to make them easier to manage. Existing keys without an alias may be
      referred to by I(key_id). Use M(aws_kms_info) to find key ids. Required
      if I(key_id) is not given. Note that passing a I(key_id) and I(alias)
      will only cause a new alias to be added, an alias will never be renamed.
      The 'alias/' prefix is optional.
    required: false
    aliases:

  state:
    description: Whether a key should be present or absent. Note that making an
