short_description: Manage AWS Batch Job Queues
description:
    - This module allows the management of AWS Batch Job Queues.
      It is idempotent and supports "Check" mode.  Use module M(aws_batch_compute_environment) to manage the compute
      environment, M(aws_batch_job_queue) to manage job queues, M(aws_batch_job_definition) to manage job definitions.

version_added: "2.5"

      - The name for the job queue

      - Describes the desired state.

  job_queue_state:
    description:
      - The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED , it is able to accept jobs.
    default: "ENABLED"
    choices: ["ENABLED", "DISABLED"]
    type: str
  priority:
    description:
      - The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a lower integer value for the priority
        parameter) are evaluated first when associated with same compute environment. Priority is determined in
        ascending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of 1 is given scheduling preference over a job
        queue with a priority value of 10.

    type: int
  compute_environment_order:
    description:
      - The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job
        scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should execute a given job. Compute
        environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to
        3 compute environments with a job queue.
