short_description: Manage AWS Batch Job Definitions
description:
    - This module allows the management of AWS Batch Job Definitions.
      It is idempotent and supports "Check" mode.  Use module M(aws_batch_compute_environment) to manage the compute
      environment, M(aws_batch_job_queue) to manage job queues, M(aws_batch_job_definition) to manage job definitions.

    type: dict
  image:
    description:
      - The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker
        Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` repository-url /image <colon>tag ``.
        Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes,
        and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker
        Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run.
    type: str
  vcpus:
    description:
      - The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container
        section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. Each vCPU is equivalent to
        1,024 CPU shares.
    type: int
  memory:
    description:
      - The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory
        specified here, the container is killed. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the
        Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run.
    type: int
  command:
    description:
      - The command that is passed to the container. This parameter maps to Cmd in the Create a container section of
        the Docker Remote API and the COMMAND parameter to docker run. For more information,

  volumes:
    description:
      - A list of data volumes used in a job. List of dictionaries.
    suboptions:
      host:
        description:
          - The contents of the host parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container
            instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host
            path for your data volume, but the data is not guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with
            it stop running.
            This is a dictionary with one property, sourcePath - The path on the host container
            instance that is presented to the container. If this parameter is empty,then the Docker daemon has assigned
            a host path for you. If the host parameter contains a sourcePath file location, then the data volume
            persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the
            sourcePath value does not exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the
            location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.
      name:
        description:
          - The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are
            allowed. This name is referenced in the sourceVolume parameter of container definition mountPoints.

      readOnly:
        description:

        to docker run.
    type: str
  privileged:
    description:
      - When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance
        (similar to the root user). This parameter maps to Privileged in the Create a container section of the
        Docker Remote API and the --privileged option to docker run.
    type: str
  ulimits:
