notes:
  - Environment variables DO_OAUTH_TOKEN can be used for the oauth_token.
  - As of Ansible 1.9.5 and 2.0, Version 2 of the DigitalOcean API is used, this removes C(client_id) and C(api_key) options in favor of C(oauth_token).
  - If you are running Ansible 1.9.4 or earlier you might not be able to use the included version of this module as the API version used has been retired.

requirements:
  - "python >= 2.6"
