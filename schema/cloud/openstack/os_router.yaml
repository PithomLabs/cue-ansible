description:
   - Create or Delete routers from OpenStack. Although Neutron allows
     routers to share the same name, this module enforces name uniqueness
     to be more user friendly.
options:
   state:
     description:
        - Indicate desired state of the resource
     choices: ['present', 'absent']
     default: present
   name:
     description:
        - Name to be give to the router
     required: true
   admin_state_up:
     description:
        - Desired admin state of the created or existing router.
     type: bool
     default: 'yes'
   enable_snat:
     description:
        - Enable Source NAT (SNAT) attribute.
     type: bool
   network:
     description:
        - Unique name or ID of the external gateway network.
        - required I(interfaces) or I(enable_snat) are provided.
   project:
     description:
        - Unique name or ID of the project.
     version_added: "2.2"
   external_fixed_ips:
     description:
        - The IP address parameters for the external gateway network. Each
          is a dictionary with the subnet name or ID (subnet) and the IP
          address to assign on the subnet (ip). If no IP is specified,
          one is automatically assigned from that subnet.
   interfaces:
     description:
        - List of subnets to attach to the router internal interface. Default
          gateway associated with the subnet will be automatically attached
          with the router's internal interface.
          In order to provide an ip address different from the default
          gateway,parameters are passed as dictionary with keys as network
          name or ID(net), subnet name or ID (subnet) and the IP of
          port (portip) from the network.
          User defined portip is often required when a multiple router need
          to be connected to a single subnet for which the default gateway has
          been already used.
